It is one of three extant species in the genus Isurus and the only extant member of the Isuridae family. The shortfin mako shark was first described in 1809 by French naturalist Jean Charles Chenu. Its specific epithet is the ancient Greek for \"sharp nose\", derived from oxys \"sharp\" and rhynchos \"nose\". The shark is characterized by a long, conical snout and a large, spindle-shaped body.

The palace economy of the Aegean region and Anatolia that characterised the Late Bronze Age was replaced, after a hiatus, by the isolated village cultures of the Greek Dark Ages.", "The Bronze Age collapse refers to the transition period between the advanced Bronze Age and the advent of the Iron Age. This period was characterized by an apparent political and social breakdown in the Mediterranean and Near East regions. The Bronze Age collapse occurred after the Late Bronze Age and led to the Dark Ages. The Bronze Age collapse is believed to have occurred due to climatic changes that led to a severe drought in the region.", "The Bronze Age collapse was a period of transition in the Aegean Region, Southwestern Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean, that took place from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age (c. 1200 BC). It was a dark-age transition period in the Near East, Anatolia, the Caucasus, the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean, marking the transition from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between Troy and Gaza was violently destroyed, and many abandoned, including Hattusa, Mycenae, and Ugarit. The palace economy of the Aegean Region and Anatolia that characterised the Late Bronze Age disintegrated, transforming into the small isolated village cultures of the Greek Dark Ages. In the first phase of the collapse, the advanced palace cultures of the Aegean Region were destroyed. The following (second) phase saw the rise of simple pottery and copper weapons in Greece. The disappearance of the palace cultures in the Aegean Region and Anatolia and the related disruption of trade routes in the Eastern Mediterranean are commonly attributed to the Dorian invasion, although alternative theories have been proposed, such as a widespread drought.", "The Bronze Age collapse is a transition in the Aegean region, Anatolia, the Levant, and the Arabian Peninsula, from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age. The transition period is sometimes described as a \"dark age\". The term \"Bronze Age collapse\" was coined by the archaeologist and historian Robert Drews. The Bronze Age collapse is not seen as a single event; rather, it is viewed as a process that encompasses multiple events that first occurred around the 12th century BC, and then subsequently resulted in the Bronze Age collapse. The Bronze Age collapse has been associated with population migrations, the Dorian invasion, the Trojan War, the Sea Peoples invasions, the Greek Dark Ages, the Hittite Empire's downfall, the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization, the migration of the Israelites, the fall of Babylon, the collapse of the Hittite Empire, the collapse of the Assyrian Empire and the collapse of the Egyptian New Kingdom. The process of the collapse was studied by German and Austrian archaeologists and historians, who traced the origins of its collapse to the eastern Mediterranean. Various explanations have been proposed, including natural disasters, invasions from the Sea Peoples, and catastrophes in climate change."]}

The \"Sea Peoples\" are usually identified as the primary cause of the collapse of the Bronze Age, although other theories also exist. The migrations of the Sea Peoples have been linked to an alleged climate change event, the 4.2 kiloyear event, which occurred just before the Bronze Age collapse.", "The term \"collapse\" is somewhat misleading, because the event was not a sudden, dramatic process, but rather a gradual process, spanning several decades. The Bronze Age collapse is often considered a transition to the Iron Age, with the advent of the Iron Age after the collapse, rather than directly after the end of the Bronze Age. The Bronze Age collapse, though a rapid and often violent process, is not a simple process. The causes of the collapse are multifaceted and still under discussion. In fact, the \"collapse\" is a modern-day term that describes a very complex process that took place over centuries.", "The causes of the collapse are still debated. Several theories have been proposed by historians. In addition to the possibility of natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, invasion from Dorian Greek tribes, the Sea Peoples, and the collapse of long-distance trade have all been suggested. The nature of the collapse varied in each region: the northern kingdoms of Assyria and Urartu, which had existed throughout the Bronze Age, were relatively unaffected. Around the Aegean, the collapse transition was gradual, whereas in Eastern Mediterranean, the collapse transition was violent. The transition to the Greek Dark Ages, which is described as a \"break\" in Greek history, is also considered to have begun with the end of the Mycenaean palaces in around 1200 BCE. The collapse is generally associated with the invasion of the Dorians, although the two events may be unconnected.", "The evidence for the collapse in the Late Bronze Age is overwhelming. In the Near East, evidence for the transition from Late Bronze Age to Iron Age is seen in the transition from Minoan to Mycenaean Greece. For example, the royal tombs of Mycenae, which were built between 1550 and 1250 BC and contain goods imported from the Levant and elsewhere, were used until about 1100 BC, when they were deliberately burned. The destruction of the palace in Pylos, dated to the same period, is even more dramatic. Pylos, like Mycenae, was destroyed and then abandoned. The destruction of Bronze Age sites in Greece and elsewhere around the Mediterranean is often attributed to the Dorians, but this is not universally accepted. The presence of a single type of pottery, the destruction of the palace in Pylos, the destruction of cities, and the disappearance of writing are all seen as evidence of the Dorian invasion. At the same time, the destruction of every major palace in Anatolia and the appearance of many new sites in the eastern Mediterranean, such as Ephesus, strongly suggest a migration into Anatolia. The destruction of palace sites in Anatolia and the Levant, the destruction of sites in the Aegean and the appearance of new sites in Greece, the destruction of some sites in southern Italy, and the destruction of Hatti all suggest a migration from Anatolia."]}

This hypothesis was first advanced by Carl Blegen in 1933 and has been supported by scholars such as George Mylonas, John Chadwick, and Rhys Carpenter.", "There are many theories regarding the causes of the Bronze Age collapse. The most popular theory is the military hypothesis, which maintains that the collapse was triggered by a sudden and widespread breakdown of military control, leading to widespread invasion and looting by nomadic peoples. Other theories include natural disasters like earthquakes or climate change, which may have severely damaged the local economies or undermined the military capabilities of the city-states. The causes of the Bronze Age collapse are still a topic of debate among historians, with the military hypothesis and the natural disasters theory being the two main competing theories.", "A number of explanations have been proposed for the Bronze Age collapse, and it remains an area of active investigation. The archaeologist D. H. Sandars has noted the difficulties of identifying a single cause for the fall of so many civilizations roughly contemporaneously. He hypothesizes that the collapse was the result of invasions by nomadic pastoralists from the Eurasian steppes, who conducted raids for the purposes of looting and enslavement, rather than conquest. In this view, the collapse marked the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age in the Ancient Near East. Other scholars have argued that the nomadic invasions were either not a factor, or only played a minor role.", "The ancient Greek historian Herodotus suggested that the Bronze Age collapse was based on the invasion of the Sea Peoples. \"The Phoenicians, who alone of all the nations make no account of him [Homer] and who have never even heard of him, say that the poet is a native of their country and that his name is H\u0113siodos.\" - Herodotus, Histories. Book 2.53. In this view, the destruction of Late Bronze Age IIIb settlements in the eastern Mediterranean is attributed to the arrival of the Sea Peoples and their destruction of Mycenaean and Hittite sites and the disruption of the international system of Assur which provided the raw materials and trade routes necessary to maintain the Late Bronze Age palace economy."]}

No origin for the Sea Peoples has been agreed upon by scholars.", "The Sea Peoples were seafaring raiders who harried the coastal towns and cities of the Mediterranean region in the 13th century BC. The term \"Sea Peoples\" was coined by the Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses II in an inscription to describe the various ethnic groups who attacked Egypt in the Late Bronze Age, especially in the 13th century BC. They were first described in inscriptions found in Medinet Habu, an important administrative center on the west bank of the Nile River in Thebes, which is now Luxor, Egypt. The Egyptians distinguished the Sea Peoples from the other groups that had been attacking Egypt, such as the Libyans, who were described as \"vile Asiatics\" rather than \"foreigners\". The Sea Peoples' origin is uncertain, and they are probably not a single people or tribe, but rather a confederation of several groups, some of which later settled in the area. The term \"Sea Peoples\" was first used by the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramesses II (1279\u20131213 BC) in his reliefs at Medinet Habu and Karnak, to describe the peoples of the Aegean Sea, who were trying to invade Egypt and attack the city of Ramses."]}

The word toilet is actually a French word, which means little cloth or little cloth. In the past, when people washed, they used a small piece of cloth to wipe the water on their hands. Later, people used a small piece of cloth to wipe their hands in the toilet, so people gradually called the toilet a toilet.

The first \u201cmodern\u201d plumbing systems were invented in the 1840s in England, and they made their way to the United States in the 1850s. The first recorded modern toilet was installed in a home in 1858. While many homes had some form of plumbing before then, the plumbing was used for bathrooms and kitchens, not toilets.

Acid reflux can occur at any time of day. However, the symptoms are more frequent or severe when lying down, especially immediately after eating.", "The most common cause of acid reflux is called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD usually happens because the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) \u2014 the muscular valve where the esophagus joins the stomach \u2014 opens at the wrong time or does not close properly. Acid reflux can also happen due to a hiatal hernia. This is a condition in which the upper part of the stomach and LES move above the diaphragm, a muscle that separates your stomach from your chest. Normally, the diaphragm helps keep acid in our stomach. But if you have a hiatal hernia, acid can move up into your esophagus and cause symptoms of acid reflux disease. These are other common risk factors for acid reflux disease: Eating large meals or lying down right after a meal. Being overweight or obese. Eating a heavy meal and lying on your back or bending over at the waist. Snacking close to bedtime. Eating certain foods, such as citrus, tomato, chocolate, mint, garlic, onions, or spicy or fatty foods. Drinking certain beverages, such as alcohol, carbonated drinks, coffee, or tea.

It can occur at any time during the day. Acid reflux is a very common condition that occurs when stomach acid flows back up into the food pipe. It is a symptom of GERD or gastroesophageal reflux disease. Acid Reflux Causes There are multiple causes of acid reflux, but the most common is the weakening of the lower oesophageal sphincter, or LES. The LES is a muscle located at the bottom of the oesophagus, whose sole purpose is to prevent the backflow of gastric juices into the oesophagus. The LES is supposed to open and close every time you swallow. When it doesn't function properly and opens at inappropriate times, it allows the acidic contents of the stomach to flow back up into the oesophagus, causing a burning sensation. This is known as acid reflux. Other causes of acid reflux include: Tight-fitting clothes Pregnancy Smoking Excess weight Poor eating habits Certain foods, such as fatty and fried foods, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol and mint Stress Certain medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen and muscle relaxers"]}

Perhaps the most obvious is the fact that there is a lot to learn. Not only does a new language involve a new vocabulary, but it also involves a new way of talking about the world. New grammatical structures, verb tenses, and sentence syntax are all part of the language learning process. Also, some languages are more difficult to learn than others. It is much easier to learn a language that is related to your native language than it is to learn a language that is unrelated. For example, it is much easier for a native English speaker to learn Spanish or French than it is to learn Chinese or Arabic. This is because English, Spanish, and French are all members of the Indo-European language family, whereas Chinese and Arabic are not. This means that a native English speaker will have a much easier time learning Spanish or French, because these languages share many similarities with English, whereas Arabic and Chinese are completely different from English.", "Learning a second language at an adult age is so difficult, because your brain has already made a neural network for your native language and it is difficult to make a neural network for your second language, it is a very long and hard process. Your brain makes a lot of connections for your native language, the more connections there are, the more difficult it is to have new connections for your second language. Your brain already knows how to speak your native language. You already have all the connections, you know how to talk, so why bother learning a new language?

Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were first introduced in the United States on March 31, 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail, by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz.

Netflix was launched on April 14, 1998, as the world's first online DVD rental store, with only 30 employees and 925 titles available, which was almost the entire catalogue of DVDs in print at the time, through the pay-per-rent model with rates and due dates that were similar to its bricks-and-mortar rival, Blockbuster. Netflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1999, and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time, the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.", "Netflix is a video streaming service with over 17 million subscribers. It was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph. The two men decided to start Netflix after Randolph watched Apollo 13 at his house and realized that he had forgotten to return the movie to the video store. Watching this movie cost him $40 in late fees! Hastings and Randolph decided that they would create a company to rent DVDs by mail, and Netflix was born. The company began as a small local operation in Santa Cruz, California, with Randolph and Hastings as the only employees. In 1999, the company moved its headquarters to Los Gatos, California, and launched its website. Netflix went public in 2002 and began offering subscription services the same year."]}

Evolution as such is a change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms through successive generations. This is commonly referred to as microevolution. Common descent means that all organisms that have ever lived on Earth are descended from a single common ancestor. Gradualism is the idea that evolution occurs at a slow and steady rate. Population speciation is the formation of two or more distinct genetic populations from a single group of organisms. This is commonly referred to as macroevolution. Natural selection is the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations of a population. This is commonly referred to as microevolution.", "Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection falls into the general category of theories of biological evolution. Specifically, it explains how populations of organisms change over time in response to changes in their environment. The theory also tries to explain how new species emerge. The core of Darwin's theory is natural selection. This process, he thought, drives evolution by favoring individuals that have certain inherited traits that are well adapted to the environment. For example, if giraffes evolved short necks, they would not be able to graze on the tall trees. Selection favors those animals with longer necks. Over time, natural selection causes populations to evolve in response to environmental conditions.", "Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, also called Darwinism, can be further divided into 5 parts: evolution as such, common descent, gradualism, population speciation, and natural selection. Darwin made several observations which made him conclude that evolution was possible. First, he noticed that plants and animals do not always breed true. This means that their offspring are not always identical to them. For example, parents can produce different colors in their offspring. Also, some plants can produce non-flowering offspring. Second, Darwin also observed that there is variation among individuals within a species. He noticed that despite having the same parents, siblings can be quite different from one another. Finally, he observed that some of these traits are heritable. He noticed that if one parent is tall, the offspring is more likely to be tall as well."]}

Natural selection occurs when some individuals in a population are better adapted to their environment than others and therefore survive to produce offspring. For example, suppose a population of rabbits has a range of coat colours. Predators can easily spot darker coloured rabbits and are more likely to eat them. The darker rabbits are less likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their genes. Their offspring will also inherit the genes for light colour. Over time rabbits in this population will all be light coloured. This is an example of natural selection.", "Darwin came up with the idea that species evolve over time through natural selection. He argued that more offspring are born than can possibly survive, putting a kind of pressure on surviving offspring. This pressure leads to a process called \"survival of the fittest,\" in which animals with advantageous traits have a better chance of surviving to pass on those traits to their offspring. The idea of natural selection is that the individuals that survive to pass on their genes are those that are best suited to their environment. It's important to note that natural selection does not mean that individuals become better adapted. Instead, natural selection means that individuals that are best suited to the environment survive and reproduce most successfully.", "At the time of Darwin's birth, the dominant idea in Western societies was that all organisms were created by an act of God. In the 1600s, the idea that new species could arise by diverging from older species had been proposed by a scholar named Robert Plot, who was the first to publish in England a full description of fossils in rocks.

He explained that living things are produced in two ways. Asexual reproduction is the production of a new individual from a single parent. Sexual reproduction is the production of a new individual from two parents. He also explained that sexual reproduction is more common among multicellular organisms, while asexual reproduction is more common among single-celled organisms.", "Sexual and asexual reproduction are two methods of reproduction that occur in the natural world. Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of a sperm and an egg to form a new organism. Asexual reproduction, meanwhile, involves a single parent and produces genetically identical offspring. In asexual reproduction, there is no fusion of gametes and no production of a new organism, though there is the production of new cells. Asexual reproduction is relatively simple to understand, but sexual reproduction is actually a complex process. The key difference between these two forms of reproduction is that, in asexual reproduction, only one organism is involved and, in sexual reproduction, two organisms are involved.", "Evolution by natural selection is one of the basic tenets of biology. In a nutshell, it states that \"survival of the fittest\" means that only the strongest, most well-adapted organisms will survive in a given environment. The process of evolution through natural selection is critical for understanding biology, but it can be difficult to understand because it is abstract and because the changes that it produces happen over very long periods of time. Natural selection is the mechanism by which evolution takes place. Natural selection occurs when some individuals in a population have traits that make them better able to survive and reproduce and pass on their traits to the next generation.", "There are two types of reproduction: sexual and asexual. In sexual reproduction, two parents pass on traits to their offspring. The offspring are not exact copies of the parents. For example, a baby's traits depend on which genes are passed on from its parents. If a baby inherits a certain gene from one parent, it won't have that gene from the other parent. The more differences that can occur during sexual reproduction, the greater the chance that the offspring will have traits that will help it survive. Asexual reproduction is when a single organism produces offspring. The offspring are exact copies of the parent. Asexual reproduction is faster than sexual reproduction, but it doesn't lead to as much genetic variation."]}

While we all feel sad or depressed from time to time, clinical depression is more than just feeling sad or unhappy. It's a serious mental health condition that affects the way a person thinks, feels, and views the world. Someone with depression may have mood swings and extreme changes in behavior. However, the symptoms of depression vary from person to person, and it's important to remember that two people with depression will never have the same symptoms. The good news is that depression is treatable, and many people get better with treatment. If you think someone you care is suffering from depression, it's important to get help. You can help a family member who is depressed or find help for a friend. To spot the signs of depression in someone you care about, you should know what the symptoms are."]}

Artists painted unnerving, illogical scenes with photographic precision, created strange creatures from everyday objects and developed painting techniques that allowed the unconscious to express itself. Their aim was to resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality. Surrealism developed out of the Dada activities during World War I and the most important center of the movement was Paris. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, eventually affecting the visual arts, literature, film and music of many countries and languages, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy, and social theory.", "Surrealism was an art movement in the 1920s and 1930s, which encompassed painting, sculpture, photography and cinema. Surrealist artists sought to channel the unconscious in order to unlock the power of the imagination. The movement was founded in 1924 by Andr\u00e9 Breton and the writers and artists associated with him. Surrealism was both an artistic and literary movement, with writers like Breton, Paul \u00c9luard, Louis Aragon, and Philippe Soupault, as well as artists like Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy, Andr\u00e9 Masson, Salvador Dal\u00ed, and Joan Mir\u00f3, among its founders and most notable members.", "Surrealism was a European art movement that pursued a particular type of expression, one that can be described as well beyond the real, as irrational, as imaginative. It was an art of the subconscious and the unconscious, of dreams and fantasy, of the irrational and the hallucinatory. Its origins were in early 20th-century Dadaism, but the movement itself emerged following World War I and lasted until well after World War II. It fizzled out in the 1950s, but its influence was felt for decades thereafter. Surrealist art can be seen as a search for a new reality, for a new way of seeing and interpreting the world.", "Artistic movements are large-scale tendencies in the visual arts world. They're often vague and can be hard to pinpoint. The same is true of Surrealism, and the movement is often criticized for being too broad. The general idea is that Surrealism sought to reveal the unconscious mind through art, and the movement was closely tied to the writings of Sigmund Freud. Surrealist artists would often employ what was known as ' automatic writing ' in which artists would write or draw without putting any thought into it. The goal was to create art that was free of rational thought. Because of this, Surrealist artworks are often filled with symbolism and often take the form of dream imagery."]}

The movement was focused on the unconscious mind and the idea of free association. The movement was created by Andre Breton who is considered to be the founder of surrealist thought. The surrealist movement was an art movement that began in the 1920s. The main idea behind surrealism was for the painter to paint whatever came to mind, with no regard for what was real or not. The idea was to paint in a way that was similar to a person's dream. The surrealist movement was influenced by Freudian psychology and the idea that humans have a subconscious mind that can be tapped into."]}

In humans, mature red blood cells are flexible and oval biconcave disks. They lack a cell nucleus and most organelles, in order to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin; they can be viewed as sacks of hemoglobin, with a plasma membrane as the sack. Approximately 2.4 million new erythrocytes are produced per second in human adults. The cells develop in the bone marrow and circulate for about 100\u2013120 days in the body before their components are recycled by macrophages. Each circulation takes about 60 seconds (one minute).

Red blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, which is the spongy tissue found in the center of certain bones. The production of red blood cells is called erythropoiesis. The process begins when a stem cell in the bone marrow divides. The new cells are called erythroblasts, or blast cells. As the cells mature, they begin to produce hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in the red blood cells that binds oxygen. When the cell is full of hemoglobin, it is called a reticulocyte.

A stem cell is a cell that can differentiate into any other cell in the body. Red blood cells are created in the red bone marrow, which is a spongy material located inside certain bones. The red blood cell creation process starts with a stem cell and ends with a mature red blood cell. The process takes about a week and a half. The first step of the red blood cell creation process is a stem cell becoming a proerythroblast. A proerythroblast is a cell that has the ability to become a red blood cell.

Endothermy is the ability of an animal to maintain a high, stable body temperature by heat generated internally. All mammals have hair, although in different amounts. In general, the body is covered with hair, but there are exceptions such as whales and dolphins. Monotremes: The monotremes are mammals that lay eggs but give birth to their young. There are three kinds of monotremes: the platypus, the echidnas and the extinct species, the Long-beaked echidna. Marsupials: Marsupials are mammals that carry their young in a pouch. Marsupials are found in Australia and South America. The most well-known marsupials are the kangaroos and koalas. Placental mammals: Placental mammals give birth to live young and feed on milk produced by their mother. This group of mammals is the largest and is found on every continent.

They use fewer parts, and those parts are less noisy, which reduces the overall noise level. Electric cars don't produce any sound when they're idling. You can't hear an electric car coming. Cons of Electric Vehicles: Higher upfront cost. It's true that electric vehicles are more expensive than gas-powered cars. While electric vehicles have a higher upfront cost, they require less fuel. Electric cars may cost more to purchase, but they're far less expensive to maintain and run. The average cost to fuel an electric car is $485 per year, compared to $1,117 per year for a gasoline-powered car. Limited range. One of the biggest disadvantages of electric vehicles is that they have a limited driving range. These cars can only travel a certain distance before needing to be refueled. The driving range for electric cars varies widely. Some models can only travel about 100 miles on a single charge, while others can last for more than 200 miles. Limited charge stations. The United States currently has more than 1,200 charging stations, with more than 2,000 outlets. That's not a lot, but it's a start. Drivers who want to use electric vehicles will need to find a way to recharge their battery whenever they need to go somewhere that's out of their driving range."]}

The name of the bird was then passed to the country.", "The turkey, by the way, is named after the country of Turkey. The country of Turkey, in turn, is named after the Turkic people who once lived in central Asia. The Turkic peoples were named after Turkistan, which was an area in the middle of Asia. Turkistan was named after the Turkic peoples. The word Turkistan, by the way, means \"land of the Turks.\"", "Turkey is a country in the region of Eurasia. It is the largest country in Western Asia and the second largest in the Middle East. Turkey is also the 36th largest country in the world. The country is bordered by eight countries: Bulgaria and Greece to the west, Syria, Iraq and Iran to the south and Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia to the east. Turkey is home to 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is one of the world's most popular tourist destinations. The word \"turkey\" comes from the word \"turk,\" a word for people from Turkey. The word \"turkey\" is also used to refer to a bird that is native to North America. It is a large bird that was named after the country of Turkey because the bird was thought to have come from there. The bird was also commonly eaten at Thanksgiving, which may have also contributed to the name.", "The reason why this name is shared by two very different countries is because of its history. Turkey, the country, was originally known as the Ottoman Empire. It was called this because of its founder, Osman I. He was the Ottoman bey, the political and military leader of a small state in the northwest of Asia Minor. In the 13th century, the Ottoman bey conquered part of the Byzantine Empire and began to expand his territory to other parts of Europe. By the 16th century, the Ottoman Empire had reached as far west as Vienna, as far east as the Caspian Sea and as far south as Alexandria in Egypt. The empire had a population of more than 30 million people and lasted for more than 600 years. The name \"Turkey\" was first used by Europeans to refer to this country because they thought that the Ottoman Turks had come from the country of Turkey.", "This is one of the most popular questions we get asked. You might be surprised to hear that there is actually no simple answer! The story is long and complicated, but we've done our best to give you the short version here. The most widely accepted theory is that the bird we call \u201cturkey\u201d was brought to Europe from North America in the 16th century. The merchants who sold the bird thought it was from Turkey, and the name \u201cturkey\u201d stuck. A second theory is that \u201cturkey\u201d is a corruption of the Turkish name for the guinea fowl, which was a bird similar to the turkey. And a third theory is that early settlers in North America called the guinea fowl \u201cturkey-cocks\u201d, and the name was later applied to the turkey. While turkey is the common name for a bird in North America, not all countries use this word. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, the name of the country Turkey is used. This is because the British brought the bird to Europe from America, and they thought it was from Turkey. So, they called it a \u201cturkey-cock\u201d or a \u201cturkey\u201d. Over time, the \u201c-cock\u201d was dropped and the name just became \u201cturkey\u201d. The name of the country Turkey comes from the Turkish language. The name \u201cTurkey\u201d comes from the Turkish language. The word \u201cT\u00fcrkiye\u201d, which means \u201cland of the Turks\u201d, is spelled with a capital T and an umlaut over the u. The umlaut is a diacritic mark (two dots) placed above a vowel in German to indicate a change in sound, and it is sometimes used in other languages. The Turkish spelling of the name can be written as \u201cT\u00fcrkiye\u201d or \u201cT\u00fcrkiye\u201d, but both words mean the same thing. The name \u201cTurkey\u201d is the unofficial name of the country in the English language. In some languages, the name of the country is different from the name of the bird. In France, the bird is called dinde, which is similar to the English name, but the country is called Turquie. In Spanish and Portuguese, the bird is pavo, and the country is Turqu\u00eda/Turquia. In Italian, the bird is tac"]}

By the time of the European arrival in the Americas, many of the Native American cultures had incorporated turkeys into their daily lives.

Although Spencer was considered a liberal, he later turned against the concept of state intervention as a result of his study of Comte.", "Spencer's evolutionary theories were drawn from Comte's ideas. Comte's philosophy was a precursor to positivism (which was later adopted by Saint-Simon, Spencer and Marx). In his work, Spencer claimed that sociology was the \"third great synthesis\" after chemistry and biology. He used the term \"synthesis\" to refer to the process of bringing together ideas from different disciplines. It was also during this time that Spencer coined the term \"survival of the fittest\", a phrase which was adopted by Darwin and is now commonly used to refer to the process of natural selection.", "The English sociologist Herbert Spencer used the term \"sociology\" in 1864. Spencer (1820\u20131903) was an early functionalist, and his work was a major part of the foundation of modern sociology. Spencer was born in Derby, England, on April 27, 1820. He was educated at home until the age of eight, at which time he entered the Derby school. Spencer first worked in the office of a railway company and then, in 1837, obtained a post in the London and Birmingham Railway. During the fifteen years of his residence in London, he studied in the evenings and spent his vacations in scientific research. He was a close friend of the philosopher John Stuart Mill."]}
{"sample_id": "79_6", "predicted_rewrite": ["What is the functionalist theory?"], "predicted_response": ["The functionalist theory, also called functionalism, is one of the major theoretical perspectives in sociology. It has its origins in the works of Emile Durkheim, who was especially interested in how social order is possible or how society remains relatively stable. As such, it is a theory that focuses on the macro-level of social structure, rather than the micro-level of everyday life. Functionalism addresses society as a whole in terms of function of its constituent elements such as norms, customs, traditions and institutions. A common analogy, popularized by Herbert Spencer, presents these parts of society as \"organs\" that work toward the proper functioning of the \"body\" as a whole.", "Functionalism is a theory about the nature of mental states. According to functionalism, mental states are identified by what they do rather than by what they are made of. This can be understood by thinking about artifacts. The way that an artifact is designed to function (i.e., what it is designed to do) determines what kind of thing it is. A knife, for example, is designed to cut; a flashlight is designed to illuminate a dark space; and so on. Similarly, functionalists claim that the nature of a mental state is determined by its causal role\u2014that is, by what it is designed to do, or the function it is designed to serve.", "Functionalism is a theory about the nature of mental states. According to functionalism, mental states are identified by what they do rather than by what they are made of. This can be understood by thinking about artifacts like mousetraps or key chains, which are useful in virtue of the way they function, regardless of the specific physical details of their construction. For example, a mousetrap is a mousetrap, no matter what material it is made of, as long as it can catch a mouse. Functionalism is the thesis that mental states are identified by their causal relations to sensory inputs, behavioral outputs, and other mental states, where a mental state is identified by its causal role\u2014that is, by the way it functions, or the role it plays, in the causal interactions of the system in which it is embedded.", "Functionalism is a theory about the nature of mental states. According to functionalism, mental states are identified by what they do rather than by what they are made of. This can be understood by thinking about artifacts in the world that have functions. A knife, for example, is defined by its function rather than its composition (it could be made of different materials and still be a knife). Functionalism is often stated in terms of the functional role, which is a theoretical construct that gives the causal relations between a mental state and stimuli, responses, and other mental states. Functionalism originated in the work of the American philosopher and psychologist William James, who was one of the founders of American psychology. Like other forms of behaviorism, functionalism reached its peak in the early 20th century. Functionalism has since declined in popularity in favor of cognitive theories.", "The functionalist theory was proposed by Talcott Parsons and proposed that the society is made up of different parts each with a specific function. Each part of the society has to work together and if one part is not working, the whole system will be affected. Functionalism is based on the belief that every part of the society is important and each part of the society must work together to run the society. There are two types of functionalism, manifest function and latent function. Manifest function is the intended function of a given social pattern while latent function is the unintended function of a given social pattern."]}

The notion that society is held together by social consensus has been challenged by structural conflict theories that highlight inequality and power differentials. The functionalist perspective was also criticized for failing to account for social change, or how social processes might change over time.", "The main criticism of functionalism is that it is too deterministic; it does not allow for individual choice. Critics argue that people are not born with a preset role to play, that they do not act like robots, and that they can make rational choices about their behaviour.", "Functionalism has been criticized for neglecting the negative functions of an element. Robert Merton, for example, argued that social structures may function in a way that may harm or benefit people. He further argued that while a structure may be functional for the stability of society as a whole, it may be dysfunctional for the individuals within it. For example, in a society with a capitalist economic structure, private property may be functional in that it provides an incentive for people to work hard so that they can keep what they produce. However, such a structure may also be dysfunctional in that it leads to social inequality.", "Functionalism is a broad school of thought that attempts to examine society at a high level of abstraction. Function is defined as a useful or relevant action, set of actions, or process. This theory has been criticized by other sociological schools of thought, including those that argue that social phenomena are neither functional nor dysfunctional, but rather neutral. Functionalism's chief contribution to sociology is a conceptual framework that is useful in understanding how social institutions contribute to the maintenance and reproduction of society.", "Critics of functionalism have presented a number of arguments against its usefulness as a perspective in the study of society. First, functionalism does not consider the possibility that one element of society may be dysfunctional for another part of society. For example, a society may include a military that protects the society from invasion, but at the same time the military may be used to oppress the people in the society. Second, functionalism does not consider the possibility that one institution may perform more than one function for a society. For example, the military can function to protect the society from attack, but it may also function to employ a large number of people. Third, functionalism assumes that all parts of a society are contributing to its stability. Critics of functionalism argue that it is impossible to prove that all parts of a society are contributing to its stability."]}

Unlike functionalism, conflict theory is better at explaining social change, and weaker at explaining social stability.", "Conflict theory sees social life as a competition, and focuses on the distribution of resources, power, and inequality. Functionalism, on the other hand, argues that society is held together by social consensus, and sees society as functioning like an organism.", "Functionalists focus on the positive aspects of society, such as integration, cooperation, and shared social order. Conflict theorists focus on the negative aspects of society, such as conflict, inequality, and competition. Functionalists believe that everything in society is interrelated and contributes to society's functioning as a whole. Conflict theorists believe that social order is maintained by domination and power. Functionalists view society as a system of interrelated parts that work together to maintain a state of balance and social equilibrium. Conflict theorists believe that society is structured in terms of conflict and competition.", "The functionalist theory emphasizes the consensus and order that exist in society. The functionalist theory focuses on the positive aspects of society by emphasizing the collective conscience (shared values or morals) in society. The functionalist theory also believes that society is held together by social consensus, in which members of the society agree upon, and work together to achieve, what is best for society as a whole. The conflict theory, another major theoretical perspective in sociology, focuses on the perceived unfair distribution of resources and power in society. Conflict theorists believe that social life refers to conflict and competition rather than consensus and order.", "Sociologists in the traditions of structural functionalism and conflict theory have differing views of the functioning of social institutions. Whereas functionalists view social institutions as working to maintain an orderly society, conflict theorists see these institutions as functioning primarily to maintain the interests of those with power and wealth. Whereas conflict theory views social institutions as working to maintain an orderly society through social consensus, symbolic interactionists view social institutions as working to maintain the interests of those with power and wealth."]}

The theory is most commonly associated with Karl Marx, although some of its main ideas can be traced back to ancient philosophy.", "For example, in a capitalist society, the rich and powerful have a greater ability to shape laws and government policy to serve their interests. Conflict theory looks at the vast income inequalities in the United States, and how those at the top, who control the means of production, rely on the working class to produce profit.", "Examples of conflict theory can be found in a range of different areas of society. For example, conflict theorists might look at access to health care and the impact of this on people's ability to work and lead full lives. They might look at the relationship between the police, politicians and the public, and how this influences the way people think about the criminal justice system. They might look at the different roles played by men and women in society and how these roles reflect and sustain inequality between the sexes.", "Modern examples of the conflict perspective can be found in popular social issues such as: poverty and wealth, drug use and abuse, and racial profiling. Poverty is an example of a conflict perspective issue. Sociologists who support the conflict theory believe that the rich and powerful in society use their wealth and influence to maintain a position of power. On the other hand, those who are considered poor may not be as influential and have less power. When the wealthy and powerful control the media, they have the ability to influence the public's opinion, which in turn can provide them with a means to maintain power. Drug use and abuse is another example of a conflict perspective issue. The wealthy, upper class may have more access to illegal drugs than the lower classes. In addition, the wealthy may be able to afford the best defense attorneys who can get them off the hook when they get caught using illegal drugs."]}

The Corps", "Sacagawea was a Shoshone Indian girl born in 1788. She was captured by the Hidatsa tribe of North Dakota when she was about twelve years old. A few years later, she was sold as a slave to a French trapper named Toussaint Charbonneau, who made her his wife. In 1804, the expedition met Charbonneau and Sacagawea at their home near the Mandan people in what is now North Dakota. Lewis and Clark hired Charbonneau to guide them, and Sacagawea went along as an interpreter. Sacagawea was an important member of the expedition. She knew the land and the people, and was able to get information from both. She also assisted with cooking and cleaning. She was especially helpful when the expedition became lost, and when they needed to build canoes to cross the Missouri River. Sacagawea helped make the expedition a success. She is remembered mainly because she was a woman on the expedition. At the time, women had few rights and were not able to travel freely. Sacagawea was able to travel with her husband, and was able to help lead the expedition. In addition, she was able to have her baby on the expedition. She was able to carry it on her back, and did not miss work because of it. It was helpful for the expedition to have a woman, and she proved that women were capable of the same things as men."]}
