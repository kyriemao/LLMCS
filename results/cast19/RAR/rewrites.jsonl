The toilets in the palace used running water to flush waste. However, it wasn't until the late 18th century that flush toilets became the norm. In 1775, Alexander Cummings invented the S-trap, which used a U-bend under the bowl to prevent odors from exiting the toilet and entering the bathroom. Then in 1777, Joseph Bramah patented the first practical water closet. In the early 19th century, Thomas Crapper popularized the S-trap by manufacturing it for the royal family. He also invented the floating ballcock to regulate the flow of water into the toilet tank. In the late 19th century, Thomas Twyford built the first single-piece ceramic toilet. By the early 20th century, flush toilets had become the norm.", "The first toilets were probably holes in the ground. These were used around the world in almost every ancient civilization. The Romans were the first to use water to flush the waste away. They had public toilets with running water. The Romans were also the first to have personal toilets in their houses. Some of these toilets were connected to sewers. Most of the toilets were simple holes over a running stream or a cesspit. The waste was flushed away by the water. The Chinese used similar toilets as the Romans. They did not have water for flushing. Instead, they had waste collectors who came and took the waste away. They would throw the waste into the rivers or cesspits and the waste would be used as fertilizer. The Romans and Chinese were the first people to use public toilets. Most public toilets were holes in the ground. The only difference between public toilets and private toilets was that they were holes in a room instead of a hole in the floor of a house.", "Toilets in the modern world are ubiquitous and essential. However, they were not always so. The ancient Greeks and Romans used chamber pots, which they emptied into the sea. The Ancient Greeks used a primitive toilet system that was essentially a bucket of sand. It was emptied into the sea, polluting the beaches and making them unfit for swimming. People who lived near the beach were known as \u201csand dwellers\u201d. The Romans, who had a more advanced plumbing system, used a form of public toilet known as a foricae. Foricae were used for public bathing as well as for relieving oneself. Foricae were essentially a series of holes in a long bench, which allowed the user to sit with their feet dangling in a trough of water. The water would carry away the waste into a channel that led to a cesspool or sewer. Although the idea of a public toilet may seem distasteful to modern sensibilities, it was not uncommon for the wealthy and poor to use the same public facilities.", "The earliest toilets were seats over pits in the ground, or over holes dug into the earth. They were used by the Greeks and Romans and were probably common in most ancient civilizations. Pit toilets were still in use in North America and Europe in the nineteenth century. In the United States, outhouses were often built over flowing rivers and streams. In 1857, the first indoor toilet was built in England. It was connected to a sewer system. In 1885, Thomas Crapper designed the first flush toilet. He also made the first toilet with a ballcock, the device that controls the flow of water in the tank. Crapper never actually invented the flush toilet, but he did make it popular. The first modern toilet was invented by Thomas Twyford in 1885, who also happened to be the founder of Twyford Bathrooms. It was made of ceramic and was designed to flush waste into a piping system. Since then, toilets have evolved. Modern toilets are made of porcelain and are connected to a sewer system. There are many different styles of toilets, such as one-piece toilets, two-piece toilets, wall-mounted toilets, and corner toilets. Modern toilets also have other features, such as soft close seats and bidets. If you are looking for a new toilet, you can choose from many different styles."]}

Zimbardo took on the role of the superintendent, and an undergraduate research assistant took on the role of the warden. Zimbardo designed the experiment in order to induce disorientation, depersonalization, and deindividuation in the participants.

Zimbardo argued that the actions of the guards were not due to sadism or aggressive tendencies, but were a result of the situation making them believe that the prisoners were not human. He also argued that the actions of the prisoners were not due to their personalities, but were due to their situation of being powerless and unable to escape. The conclusion was that ordinary people can become either perpetrators or victims, depending on the social roles they are cast into. This conclusion drew heavily on the results of the experiment, and on the authority of Zimbardo as the leader of the experiment and a respected academic.", "The Stanford prison experiment revealed how people can adapt to roles and hurt others because of the role. Even though the experiment only lasted a few days, the participants adapted to their roles so quickly that it seemed like they had been in prison for a long time. The guards became sadistic and the prisoners became depressed and showed signs of extreme stress. These people were normal, healthy college students. It did not take long for the guards to feel a sense of power and control. There is no way to know if the guards would have continued to become more and more abusive if the experiment had gone on longer. The study has been criticized for many reasons including the fact that it may not have been ethical. Since the study was done so long ago, and because the effects of roles on behavior are so well known, it would be impossible to get approval to do the study again."]}

Randolph worked as a marketing director for Hastings' company, Pure Atria. Randolph was a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail order company, and was later employed by Borland International as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the biggest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. Hastings, Randolph's former boss, and investor Mark Cuban, provided $2.5 million in start-up capital for Netflix. Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were first introduced in the United States on March 31, 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail, by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home video sales and rental industry. Netflix was launched on April 14, 1998, as the world's first online DVD rental store, with only 30 employees and 925 titles available, which was almost the entire catalogue of DVDs in print at the time, through the pay-per-rent model with rates and due dates that were similar to its bricks-and-mortar rival, Blockbuster. Netflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1997, and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time, the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees. In 2000, when Netflix had just about 300,000 subscribers and relied on the U.S. Postal Service for the delivery of their DVDs, they were losing money and offered to be acquired by Blockbuster for $50 million, but the latter declined to proceed. The company's primary business is its subscription-based streaming service which offers online streaming of a library of films and television programs, including those produced in-house.

However, the company found that the $40 per month price tag was too high for most Americans. In 2000, Netflix introduced its monthly subscription model and began adding a large library of on-demand streaming titles. This allowed Netflix to lower the price of its standard plan while giving customers new options for watching content. Even with these changes, Netflix's DVD-by-mail business was still popular among customers with slow internet connections or who preferred to have physical copies of movies and TV shows. Netflix continued to grow its DVD-by-mail business, but it also began to shift its focus away from DVDs and toward streaming. Soon, streaming became Netflix's main business. By the end of 2011, Netflix had 23.6 million DVD subscribers but only 21.7 million streaming subscribers. The DVD business continued to decline in the following years. In 2013, Netflix announced that it would phase out its DVD-by-mail business. The company began rebranding its DVD service as Qwikster, but the change was poorly received and Netflix ultimately abandoned the idea. In November 2013, Netflix announced that it would no longer support its DVD-by-mail business.

Surrealism was developed by the poet Andre Breton and a group of writers and artists who sought to challenge the rational mind and to unleash the creative potential of the unconscious. They believed that Surrealism would enable them to express their innermost feelings and desires. Surrealism originated in the late 1910s and early '20s as a literary movement that experimented with a new mode of expression called automatic writing, or automatism, which sought to release the unbridled imagination of the subconscious. In automatic writing, the hand is allowed to move 'randomly' across the page, writing down whatever thoughts come into the writer's mind. This method of writing started to take the form of a highly personal mode of expression, which was then adopted by visual artists. In 1924, Andre Breton published the first Surrealist manifesto, in which he defined the aims of the movement. He wrote that Surrealism was a means of reuniting conscious and unconscious realms of experience so completely that the world of dream and fantasy would be joined to the everyday rational world in 'an absolute reality, a surreality.' Breton summed up the goal of Surrealism as the union of 'marvelous reality' and 'patent unreality'.", "Surrealism was a movement in art and literature that emerged after World War I. The movement was led by French poet Andre Breton, who wrote the Surrealist Manifesto in 1924. Surrealism is a style in which visual imagery is depicted as bizarre, illogical or fantastic.", "Surrealism was an art movement that became popular in the 1920s and 1930s. The artists associated with Surrealism used irrational imagery and incongruous juxtaposition to portray the power of the unconscious mind. The Surrealist movement is considered to be one of the most influential art movements of the 20th century. It began in the late 1910s and early 1920s as a literary movement that experimented with the unconscious and dream-like states. Surrealism was founded in Paris in 1924 by the writer Andr\u00e9 Breton. It was an artistic, literary and political movement. The Surrealists sought to revolutionize human experience, rejecting a rational vision of life in favour of one that asserted the value of the unconscious and dreams. The movement regarded the mythic and dream world as a source of inspiration. The French poet Guillaume Apollinaire had coined the term \u201cSurrealism\u201d in 1917, describing the play \u201cLes Mamelles de Tiresias\u201d by Guillaume Apollinaire. The Surrealists developed their art in reaction to the destruction wrought by the First World War. Through an exploration of the subconscious, they sought to discover the hidden and repressed desires of the unconscious mind, and to reveal the power of the imagination. Surrealism was heavily influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud, and many Surrealist artists believed that art should be a way of accessing the subconscious mind and revealing the unconscious thoughts and desires that motivated human behaviour.", "Surrealism first emerged in the early 1920s through the writings of French poet Andr\u00e9 Breton and his circle of artists. It was during this time that Breton, who was deeply influenced by the works of Sigmund Freud, published his Surrealist Manifesto, in which he outlined the Surrealist group's intentions and goals. \"Surrealism is pure psychic automatism by which it is intended to express, either verbally or in writing, the true function of thought,\" he wrote. \"The dictation of thought, free from any control exercised by reason, exempt from any aesthetic or moral concern.\" The Surrealists were interested in the mind, which Breton called the \"marvelous,\" and sought to explore the unconscious and the irrational in their works. While the movement had its roots in Dada, Surrealism took the notion of irrationality even further. Breton and his fellow Surrealists believed that the unconscious allowed them to tap into the primordial mind that connected individuals and that the irrational was the true expression of the human spirit. As such, they explored this realm through automatic writing, which they believed bypassed rational thought and allowed the unconscious to speak."]}

The movement is also known for its use of dream imagery and its critique of rationalism.", "Surrealism advocated the idea of automatism and wrote on the superiority of drawing over the thought-based art of the Renaissance. The group's techniques used for this purpose include frottage and grattage, which are basically the process of taking rubbings from objects or surfaces to create abstract patterns, and collage, which is the gluing of paper, fabric or other materials onto the surface of a work of art.

It was a movement that had a great impact in the world of art and culture.", "The movement is best understood by considering the writings of its foremost theorists and most prominent artists. The writers, most of whom were poets, sought to show that the logic of the subconscious mind was superior to that of the conscious mind. They also sought to free their poetry from the limitations of language, and felt that the most effective way to do this was to create poetry that was visual as well as verbal. Andr\u00e9 Breton, who was known as the Pope of Surrealism, wrote the following in 1924: 'Let us leave pretty ornaments and palaces to the bourgeoisie and the museums, and let us devote ourselves to the creation of objects that are as unfettered and as far removed from all tradition as our desires, our dreams, and our pleasures.'"]}

Apollinaire used the term in his program notes for Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, the first of which was performed in June 1917.

Each subunit consists of a heme group and a globin group. Heme group is a heterocyclic ring that contains an iron atom in its center (see the image below).

The good news is that there are several things you can do to speed up your recovery from jet lag.", "According to Dr. Timothy Morgenthaler, a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic and a world-renowned sleep expert, the key to avoiding jet lag is to reset your internal clock to the time zone where you are. He says, get out in the sun and exercise during the day, and if you have to nap, don't sleep for more than 45 minutes. You should also go to bed early and get up at the same time each day.", "Jet lag or jet lag disorder is the term used to describe the symptoms that occur when you travel across time zones. It is believed to be caused by the disruption of the body's internal clock or circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a natural, internal process that regulates the sleep-wake cycle and repeats roughly every 24 hours. When you cross several time zones, your body clock is thrown out of sync with the local time. Jet lag was first recognised in the 1960s by doctors working with the US Air Force. They noted that some pilots were experiencing fatigue and other symptoms during long-distance flights. In the 1970s, a study by researchers at Stanford University in California investigated the phenomenon further. They found that flight crew were more likely to experience jet lag if their eastward flights were longer than six hours. They also found that the effect of jet lag worsened with the number of time zones crossed. This led to the suggestion of using a jet lag calculator. Jet lag can lead to a number of symptoms, including: difficulty sleeping tiredness a lack of concentration or motivation dizziness or lightheadedness irritability headaches stomach problems, such as indigestion or constipation excessive sleepiness and daytime sleepiness. If you are travelling east, your body clock needs to adjust to an earlier time. If you are travelling west, your body clock needs to adjust to a later time. This makes it harder to sleep when you first arrive at your destination, as your body clock is still set to the time at home. When travelling east, your body clock tends to resist the change, making it harder to get to sleep at your destination in the evening. When travelling west, your body clock tends to advance more easily, making it harder to stay awake until bedtime at your destination."]}

Edward Teach, has. Born around 1680, Teach was a ruthless pirate who terrorized the West Indies, the Indian Ocean and the east coast of America. He was a fearsome sight: tall and broad, with a long black beard that he braided and tied with ribbons. He wore a wide-brimmed hat, and he had a reputation for cruelty, drinking and brutality. He used psychological warfare to intimidate and panic his victims. He would light fuses under his hat and weave them into his beard so that smoke would billow around his face. Blackbeard's ship was the Queen Anne's Revenge, a 40-gun frigate captured from the French. It was a formidable vessel, and it was manned by a crew of around 250 men. Teach recruited the most fearsome and bloodthirsty men he could find, and he was a charismatic leader who inspired loyalty in his men. It was said that Blackbeard was a formidable warrior, and he was not afraid to fight to the death. In 1717, Blackbeard and his men blockaded the port of Charleston, South Carolina. They held the entire city to ransom for a chest of medicine. The ransom was paid and the pirates departed. However, the exchange was witnessed by the Royal Navy and Blackbeard was hunted down. The man who killed Blackbeard was Lieutenant Robert Maynard, who cornered the pirate on a small sloop off the coast of North Carolina. Maynard and his men boarded the ship, and Blackbeard killed two men before he was shot five times and stabbed more than 20 times. His head was taken back to Virginia as proof that he was dead and hung from the bowsprit of Maynard's ship."]}
