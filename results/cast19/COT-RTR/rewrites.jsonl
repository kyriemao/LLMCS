Your throat is a muscular tube that starts behind your nose and ends in your neck. It's about 5 inches long in adults. Your windpipe (trachea) splits into two air tubes (bronchi) in your throat. One bronchus leads to each lung. Throat cancer begins when cells in your throat develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutations let the cells divide rapidly and continue living when normal cells would die. The accumulating abnormal cells form a tumor that can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body.", "Throat cancer describes a cancerous tumour growing in your throat (pharynx), voice box (larynx) or tonsils. Your throat is a muscular tube that begins behind your nose and ends in your neck. It's about 5 inches long and is divided into sections.

In the first phase of this period, almost every city between Pylos and Gaza was violently destroyed, and many abandoned, including Hattusa, Mycenae and Ugarit. The gradual end of the Dark Age that ensued saw the eventual rise of settled Neo-Hittite Aramaean kingdoms of the mid-10th century BC, and the emergence of the first major West Semitic-speaking nation, Aram-Damascus, followed by the arrival of the first Indo-Europeans, the Sea Peoples and the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the largest empire of the world up to that time. The collapse is commonly attributed to the invasion by the Sea Peoples, and is linked to the Bantu expansion from Central Africa, with the adaptations between the latter's technology and that of the larger Mediterranean region being a possible cause instead.

The catastrophic loss of the Mycenaean states, the Linear B script, the palatial administration, and writing skills, the reduction of trade, the disappearance of international trade, the collapse of the Hittite Empire, the disruption of trade routes and communication networks, and the movement of populations has been proposed as the reason for the collapse of the Bronze Age.

This transition has been described as a \"catastrophic dark age\" for some cultures, while others have described it as a time of rich innovations and cultural changes. The Bronze Age collapse may have been linked to a climate change event, popularly known as the Bronze Age collapse, which saw the end of the Mycenaean kingdoms and their Mediterranean empire, along with the destruction of Minoan Crete by fire.

The Bronze Age collapse was a period of crisis, upheaval and chaos around the Mediterranean region from 1207 to 1180 BCE. Around 1200 BCE, the Late Bronze Age civilizations of the Aegean, Anatolia and the Levant fell into a dark age. The Mycenaean civilization of Greece, the Hittite Empire of Anatolia and the Levantine kingdoms of Ugarit and Israel all collapsed, as did the Middle Bronze Age civilization of Egypt. Cities were destroyed, trade networks were disrupted and literacy was lost.

The destruction of the Hittite capital Hattusa around 1200 BCE is one of the most famous destructions of an ancient city, and marks the beginning of the end of the Hittite Empire.

The story of the collapse began in the Late Bronze Age, in the 12th century BC. The Hittites, the dominant power in Anatolia, were defeated by the Assyrians and Arameans. The Sea Peoples invaded Egypt.

The cause and date of the collapse is heavily debated, and several theories have been proposed. Theories include Mycenaean invasions from mainland Greece, earthquakes, droughts, plagues, widespread conflict, and the Dorian invasion. In Greece, the Linear B writing of the Greek language used by Mycenaean bureaucrats ceased. The decoration on Greek pottery after about 1100 BC lacks the figurative decoration of Mycenaean ware and is restricted to simpler, generally geometric styles (1000\u2013700 BC). It was discovered that the Mycenaean Greeks invaded and destroyed the Minoans. This contributed to the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization. The major Mycenaean cities were demolished, including Mycenae itself, Tiryns, Midea, and Pylos. Cities were destroyed and rebuilt, but the size of the Greek population declined greatly.", "The palace economy of the Aegean region and Anatolia that characterized the Late Bronze Age was replaced, after a hiatus, by the isolated village cultures of the Greek Dark Ages. The Bronze Age collapse is often linked to the eruption of Thera and the Sea Peoples invasion, both of which have been suggested as causing destabilization and economic collapse in the region. The Bronze Age collapse had been preceded by a period of increased social unrest and disruptions in the Aegean region, Anatolia and the Levant, beginning in the late 13th century BC, and lasting for about a century. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between Pylos and Gaza was violently destroyed, and many abandoned, including Hattusa, Mycenae, and Ugarit.

The Phoenicians, Aramaeans, Hebrews, and Greeks all thrived in the wake of the collapse, and Egypt and Assyria were able to grow and prosper again. The Assyrians went on to create the largest empire the world had yet seen, and the Egyptians enjoyed a period of peace that lasted for nearly 200 years. The Hittites, who had been the dominant power in the region, weakened during the collapse, and were eventually destroyed by the Assyrians around 1200 BC.

In this model, the drought-induced collapse of the Hittite Empire in the twelfth century BCE was followed closely by an intense drought that shattered Mycenaean civilization and the Egyptian New Kingdom in the late thirteenth century BCE. The period of the collapse in the Aegean was approximately 1200 to 1000 BCE, though some literary and archaeological evidence points to a collapse as early as the twelfth century BCE.

The end of the Bronze Age is often seen as the beginning of a Dark Age in a number of cultures. In the Aegean and Anatolia, the gradual end of the palatial system led to the decline of long-distance trade and the collapse of the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations. The decline of the Hittite Empire, the Old Assyrian Empire, the Middle Assyrian Empire, and the New Assyrian Empire in Anatolia and the Levant led to the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the largest and most powerful empire the world had yet seen.

He founded a plumbing business in London in 1861. He invented the ballcock, a device that is still used in toilets today. It was used to control the flow of water into the toilet tank. The first American made toilet was invented in 1891 by Thomas Twyford. It was called the 'silent valveless water waste preventer.'

Zimbardo took on the role of the superintendent, and an undergraduate research assistant the role of the warden. Zimbardo designed the experiment in order to induce disorientation, depersonalization, and deindividuation in the participants. The researchers held an orientation session for guards the day before the experiment, during which guards were instructed not to harm the prisoners physically or withhold food or drink. In the footage of the study, Zimbardo can be seen talking to the guards: \"You can create in the prisoners feelings of boredom, a sense of fear to some degree, you can create a notion of arbitrariness that their life is totally controlled by us, by the system, you, me, and they'll have no privacy ... We're going to take away their individuality in various ways. In general what all this leads to is a sense of powerlessness. That is, in this situation we'll have all the power and they'll have none.\"", "The Stanford prison experiment was a landmark psychological study of the human response to captivity, in particular, to the real world circumstances of prison life. It was conducted in 1971 by a team of researchers led by psychology professor Philip Zimbardo at Stanford University. The experiment was funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and was of interest to both the US Navy and Marine Corps as an investigation into the causes of conflict between military guards and prisoners. More than 70 people applied to participate in the experiment and ultimately, Zimbardo and his team selected the 24 males whom they deemed to be the most psychologically stable and healthy. These participants were predominantly white and of the middle class. The group was intentionally selected to exclude those with criminal backgrounds, psychological impairments, or medical problems. The participants were paid $15 per day (approximately $90 per day in 2019 dollars). The group was divided into two subgroups: 12 prisoners and 12 guards. The guards were given wooden batons to establish their status and wore identical khaki uniforms with a bold guard-prefix on the front, while the prisoners wore uncomfortable, ill-fitting smocks and stocking caps designed to humiliate them. The guards were instructed to call the prisoners by their assigned numbers, sewn on their uniforms, instead of by name. The prisoners were \"arrested\" at their homes and \"charged\" with armed robbery. The local Palo Alto police department assisted Zimbardo with the arrests and conducted full booking procedures on the prisoners, which included fingerprinting and taking mug shots. The prisoners were then transported to the mock prison located in the basement of the Stanford psychology building. In the prison, the prisoners were to stay in their cells 24 hours a day and were given simple tasks to keep them busy. The guards worked in teams of three for eight-hour shifts. They were instructed by Zimbardo to do \"whatever was necessary\" to maintain law and order in the prison and were given a nightstick, whistle and handcuffs for this purpose. The guards were not allowed to physically harm the prisoners, but they were not restricted from using psychological abuse. The experiment was conducted over a six-day period and was scheduled to last two weeks. However, it was abruptly terminated after only six days due to the guards' abusive behaviour and the extreme stress experienced by the prisoners. During the experiment, prisoner #8612 began to exhibit intense emotional disturbance that was later described by psychologists as a \"complete breakdown\". When this occurred, Zimbardo terminated the experiment early. Many of the prisoners were", "In 1971, a social psychologist named Philip Zimbardo and his colleagues set up an experiment at Stanford University, where they recruited 24 students who had an interest in psychology to play the role of prisoners or guards. Zimbardo wanted to explore the idea that the prison environment, rather than the prisoners themselves, was responsible for the abusive behavior seen in detention facilities. The subjects were randomly divided into groups: nine prisoners and nine guards. The subjects were divided by flipping a coin and the student who got the heads would become a guard and the one who got the tails would become a prisoner. The experiment was supposed to last 2 weeks but was terminated in 6 days. The first day of the experiment was called \"arrival day\". The prisoners were initially blindfolded and driven to a fake prison, their names were changed to numbers, and they were placed in a cell. The guards were dressed in khaki uniforms and sunglasses, and were given a whistle, an Everest-style cap, and a billy club. On the second day, prisoners started a rebellion by barricading themselves into their cell and blocking out the view of their cell door. Guards decided to use fire extinguishers to break into the cell. Guards released the prisoners and put them in solitary confinement. The prisoners were also forced to clean up their own mess. During the third day, the guards started to harass the prisoners by performing body and cavity searches. They also continued to put the prisoners in solitary confinement and had them clean up the toilets again. The prisoners resorted to passive resistance, refusing to eat, and in turn were forced to eat. In the evening the prisoners were given a lecture on the rules. On the fourth day, the guards started to harass and humiliate the prisoners by making them clean the toilets with their heads. The guards also forced prisoners to strip naked and perform their hygiene routine in front of each other and the guards. The prisoners started to suffer irritability, fatigue, and sleeplessness. On the fifth day, the guards woke up the prisoners to eat. The prisoners then sat in the yard and sang songs. The guards responded by making the prisoners do pushups. The guards also forced the prisoners to take off their clothes and put on women's clothes. On the sixth day, the guards woke up the prisoners to eat.

The researchers were interested in finding out whether the brutality reported among guards in American prisons was due to the sadistic personalities of the guards (i.e., dispositional) or had more to do with the prison environment itself (i.e., situational). To test this, Zimbardo converted a basement of the Stanford psychology building into a mock prison. He then advertised for research participants in a local newspaper and selected the 24 males whom he deemed to be the most psychologically stable and healthy. These participants were paid $15 per day to participate in the study. Then, Zimbardo randomly assigned the participants to be either guards or prisoners. The participants adapted to their roles well beyond Zimbardo's expectations, as the guards enforced authoritarian measures and ultimately subjected some prisoners to psychological torture. Many of the prisoners passively accepted psychological abuse and, at the request of the guards, readily harassed other prisoners who attempted to prevent it. The experiment even affected Zimbardo himself, who, in his role as the superintendent, permitted the abuse to continue.

It was a study of the psychological effects of becoming a prisoner or prison guard. The experimenters set up a mock prison and then randomly assigned college students to be either guards or prisoners. The experiment was meant to last two weeks. It was quickly apparent that the guards had a power problem and were using their power to abuse the prisoners. They did everything from insulting the prisoners to forcing them to do pushups for hours. The guards also forced the prisoners to strip naked, perform sexual acts, and do other humiliating things. This experiment showed that people can become so caught up in their roles that they will do hurtful things.", "The experiment showed how people can adapt to roles and hurt others because of the role. It showed that the roles people play become so important that their morals and values may change. As soon as the prisoners and guards entered the prison, they were given their roles to play. The prisoners were stripped, searched, deloused, and given prison uniforms to wear. They were also given a number to replace their names. They were to be referred to only by their number. The guards were given khaki uniforms and mirrored sunglasses. They were instructed to keep order and not abuse the prisoners. They were allowed to be creative in their efforts to maintain order. The guards took control quickly, which caused some of the prisoners to become upset and rebellious. The guards reacted with more power, and the prisoners rebelled even more. It was not long before the guards began to abuse the prisoners. They placed bags over the prisoners' heads, did not let them use the toilet, and forced them to clean toilets with their bare hands. The prisoners became angry and frustrated. They protested and yelled at the guards. Finally, the guards retaliated by taking away the prisoners' beds. The prisoners then staged a riot. The guards reacted by spraying them with fire extinguishers and assaulting them. The purpose of the experiment was to see how people would react to the roles of prisoner or guard."]}

Dr. Zimbardo's entire experiment was indeed unethical. He was treating people like they were animals and keeping them in a small room for hours in the middle of the night. It was unfair to the people in the study, and it was cruel and inhumane to treat them the way he did.", "Zimbardo's major claim is that the Stanford Prison Experiment demonstrated that even good people can do bad things, given the right circumstances. This claim was supported by the fact that the guards became sadistic, and the prisoners became submissive, within a matter of days. However, the major problem with the experiment is that it was highly unethical, as the guards were allowed to inflict psychological and physical harm on the prisoners. In the experiment, the guards were told to make the prisoners' lives as miserable as possible, and they were given little to no direction on how to do this. The guards were fully aware that they were allowed to inflict psychological and physical harm on the prisoners, but they were told not to cause permanent damage or injury."]}

It was conducted at Stanford University on August 14-20, 1971, by a research group led by psychology professor Philip Zimbardo using college students. It was funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and was of interest to both the US Navy and Marine Corps as an investigation into the causes of conflict between military guards and prisoners. However, the experiment is known for its negative effects on participants and is considered to be a clear violation of ethics. In the experiment, 24 male students were selected to play the roles of either prisoners or guards and were placed in a simulated prison environment. The study was intended to last for two weeks, but was ended prematurely after only six days due to what the researchers described as abusive behavior by the guards towards the prisoners, who began to show signs of extreme stress, emotional breakdowns, and abnormal behavior. Participants were recruited and told they would participate in a two-week prison simulation.", "The Stanford Prison Experiment is similar to other famous experiments in that it had negative effects on the participants. These effects include the fact that the subjects did not know what was going to happen to them, and they were not prepared for the results. The subjects were not allowed to have any food or water, and they were forced to live in a confined space. The subjects were told they would be in a prison for two weeks, but they were not given any information about the prison, and were only given two days to prepare for it.", "A few days after the Stanford Prison Experiment began, Zimbardo decided to get the research team together for a meeting. He wanted to discuss the progress of the experiment so far, but he also wanted to figure out what to do about what was becoming a major problem: Christina Maslach. At the time, she was a 26-year-old graduate student in psychology at Stanford, and she had come to visit the prison one day to observe the action. The sight of the guards' cruelty to the prisoners horrified her. She thought the experiment should be stopped immediately. A few days later, she returned to the prison, but this time she came to talk to Zimbardo. In his book about the experiment, Zimbardo described what happened next: \"Christina marches into my office, her face flushed with anger, and says, 'This is absolutely wrong! What you are doing to those boys is a terrible thing! You can't keep on doing this to them!' She proceeds to give me a detailed critique of what she had seen, how the prisoners were being treated, the sadistic effects on them.\" Zimbardo was taken aback by her criticism. He had expected everyone to see what he was doing as important research. After all, he had received permission from the university to conduct the experiment, and he had followed all of the necessary rules. But Zimbardo was deeply affected by Maslach's anger. He realized that maybe the experiment was not so ethical after all. He decided to have a meeting with the researchers and ask them what they thought."]}

It applies to the practice of living on the products of the plant kingdom to the exclusion of flesh, fish, fowl, eggs, honey, animal milk and its derivatives, and encourages the use of alternatives for all commodities derived wholly or in part from animals.\"", "Vegans are people who don't eat any animal products, including eggs and dairy. The word \"vegan\" was coined in 1944 by a small group of vegetarians who broke away from the Leicester Vegetarian Society in England to form the Vegan Society. The society's founders wanted to distinguish between vegetarians who consumed dairy products and those who did not. The definition of veganism has evolved over time. The Vegan Society defines veganism as the following: \"a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude \u2014 as far as is possible and practicable \u2014 all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.\"", "Being vegan means living a life that is free from cruelty and exploitation. Veganism is a lifestyle that excludes the use of all animal products, whether in food, clothing, or any other purpose. Vegans seek to exclude the use of animals as far as possible and practicable, and not to consume or use animal products."]}

Animal agriculture is also responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation.", "Animal agriculture is responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation. Livestock and their byproducts account for at least 32,000 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, or 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. Methane is responsible for much of this problem, as the digestive system of ruminants (cows, sheep, and goats) produces methane as a byproduct of digestion. The EPA estimates that methane is over 20 times as effective as CO2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere.", "Eating a vegan diet is good for the environment. Animal agriculture is one of the biggest contributors to environmental degradation around the world.

Transport is responsible for 13% of all greenhouse gas emissions. It is also a major source of land and water degradation. And the main source of pollution. Agriculture is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases (GHG). Greenhouse gases are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. The main cause of global warming is the use of fossil fuels, but agriculture, deforestation and other land use change also play a part. These activities release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The effect of these gases is to warm the planet.", "The UN has stated that a global shift towards a vegan diet is necessary to combat the worst effects of climate change. Animal agriculture contributes to climate change in many ways. The food and livestock sectors together account for nearly one-fifth of all human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, according to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Meat and dairy production account for nearly 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. That's more than the emissions from all forms of transportation combined. And, the FAO has said that livestock production accounts for 70% of all agricultural land and 30% of the land surface of the planet. The clearing of forests for cattle is responsible for around 20% of current carbon dioxide emissions."]}

Many people believe that the drinking age should be lowered to 18. The primary argument for lowering the drinking age from 21 is that the drinking age of 21 is not working. Statistics show that states with a drinking age of 21 have higher rates of binge drinking than states with a lower drinking age. Proponents of lowering the legal drinking age argue that the current drinking age is not helping to prevent binge drinking. In addition, the current drinking age could be encouraging underage drinkers to use fake identification to get into bars and purchase alcohol.", "The evidence suggests that lowering the drinking age has not been effective in reducing alcohol-related injuries or deaths. Many other countries have a drinking age of 18 and have not experienced this effect. In fact, one study showed that lowering the drinking age may increase the number of alcohol-related crashes. The United States is one of the few countries that has a drinking age of 21. Many other countries, including Canada and England, have a lower drinking age. In the United States, about 10 million 12-15-year-olds say they've consumed alcohol in the past month, according to a report from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The drinking age in the US is 21 because of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. The law was passed by Congress in 1984 and signed by President Ronald Reagan. The act required states to raise their minimum drinking age to 21 or face a 10% decrease in federal highway funding.", "The drinking age was changed to 21 and the rate of teenage deaths in car crashes plummeted. In 1984 and 1985, states that had not raised the drinking age to 21 were given five years to do so or lose federal highway funds. By 1988, all 50 states had raised the minimum age to 21. Since then, the rate of teen drinking and driving has fallen 63 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since the law went into effect, the rate of alcohol-related accidents has decreased dramatically. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in the year after the law went into effect, 6,000 fewer people under the age of 21 were killed on the road. In the first full year that the law was in effect, 1,000 fewer people died in alcohol-related crashes. In the first few years after the law went into effect, there was an estimated 24% decrease in alcohol-related accidents.", "In the United States, the primary argument for a minimum drinking age of 21 is that people under 21 are statistically more likely to be involved in alcohol related car accidents than people over 21. The secondary argument is that people under 21 are more likely to engage in binge drinking and risky behavior. However, even if the drinking age is raised to 21, it's not going to stop people who are under 21 from drinking. If the drinking age was 18, those people would have to go out drinking in public less, since the legal age would be 18 rather than 21. The drinking age in the US is 21. The strongest argument against lowering the drinking age is the belief that people under 21 are not mature enough to handle alcohol responsibly. But the arguments are not always logical. For example, the drinking age is 18 in Canada, and the Canadian drinking age hasn't increased the number of car accidents in Canada. The drinking age in Canada is 18, and has been for years. The reason for that is when the US lowered their drinking age to 18, Canada followed suit. There are a lot of people who think that the drinking age should be lowered, but there are a few reasons why it isn't. The most common reason for a higher drinking age is that it reduces the number of drunk driving deaths. There are also a lot of people who think that the drinking age should be lowered, but there are a few reasons why it isn't. The most common reason for a higher drinking age is that it reduces the number of drunk driving deaths.

This is because lying down with a full stomach allows acid to seep up your esophagus. The esophageal sphincter that connects your stomach to your esophagus doesn't fully close, and stomach acid gets through.", "Acid reflux is a common medical condition. It involves a burning pain around the chest area, which occurs when some of the acid from your stomach comes back up into your food pipe. You may experience acid reflux as a painful sensation in your chest. It can occur anytime, but you may experience more symptoms in the morning. This is because you\u2019re lying down for many hours without eating, which may cause the acid to back up. Lying down also makes it more likely that the acid will enter your esophagus.", "Reflux happens because the opening from your stomach to your esophagus doesn't close tightly enough. This allows acid, stomach contents, and bile to flow back into your esophagus. When this happens, you may feel the sensation of heartburn. One of the causes of acid reflux is an excess amount of acidity in the stomach. Excess acidity in the stomach can be caused by eating a diet high in sugary foods, since sugar is acid-forming. Drinking 1-3 tablespoons a day of raw apple cider vinegar can help reduce the amount of acidity in the stomach. Apple cider vinegar is a good treatment but if you want a cure, buy four bottles of low sodium V8 juice. Add salt to it. Replace your regular dinner with this drink. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Eat two or three apples a day. After a week or so, you will feel better.", "Acid reflux occurs when stomach acid backs up into your esophagus and results in the burning sensation. This is mainly caused by relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter that separates the stomach from the esophagus. The muscle usually contracts to prevent stomach acid from moving up into the esophagus. However, when it relaxes it allows the acid to flow back, causing a burning sensation in your chest. Not only do you experience pain but you also feel very uncomfortable. This is because the acid irritates the lining of your esophagus. Acid reflux can be more common in the mornings because during the night acid can build up in your stomach and not have anywhere to go. This can cause you to wake up in pain. Acid reflux is also more likely if you lie down after a large meal, as gravity will not be able to help keep your stomach contents down."]}

Randolph worked as a marketing director for Hastings' company, Pure Atria. Randolph was a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail order company, and was later employed by Borland International as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the richest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. Hastings, Randolph's mother and former defendant in the Time Warner/AOL merger, and Randolph called the newly founded Netflix a joke at first. They conceived the idea for Netflix while commuting between their homes in Santa Cruz and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger, although Hasting has given several different explanations for how the idea was created.", "Netflix has been one of the most successful dot-com ventures. Netflix was founded on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California, by Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings. Randolph worked as a marketing director for Hastings' company, Pure Atria. Randolph was a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail order company, and was later employed by Borland International as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the richest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. Hastings, Randolph's mother and father, Patricia Randolph and Warren Randolph, Jr., and Peter Adair, a Pure Atria co-founder, were early investors in Netflix. Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were first introduced in the United States on March 31, 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail, by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home video sales and rental industry. Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13, but this is an apocryphal story that he and Randolph designed to explain the company's business model and motivation.", "Netflix grew as DVD sales fell from 2006 to 2011. Netflix had long been an advocate for direct-to-video distribution, which it began doing itself in 2001 with the release of Bam Bam and Celeste. However, the company had conflicting views of the DVD format. In 2004, when the company was beginning to shift towards streaming, it signed a deal with Blockbuster, making Netflix the exclusive distributor of Blockbuster-licensed films for rent by mail. Netflix initiated an initial public offering (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at the price of US$15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5 million profit on revenues of US$272 million. In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day. Netflix's CEO Reed Hastings, along with Netflix's early employees, invested $2.5 million in a startup called Red Envelope Entertainment, which specialized in independent films and genre titles that were not widely available in the US on DVD. Netflix operated in a total of 41 countries around the world. The company had about 2,800 employees by that time, and about 1 million subscribers. The company's published subscriber counts increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's growth has been fueled by the fast spread of DVD players in households; as of 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player."]}

This in turn triggered the Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States. Sputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high atmospheric layers through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere. The unanticipated announcement of Sputnik 1s success precipitated the Sputnik crisis in the United States and ignited the so-called Space Race within the Cold War. Sputnik 2 was launched on November 3, 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit, a dog named Laika. In May, 1946, Project RAND had released the Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship, which stated, \"A satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the Twentieth Century.\" The United States had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the Bureau of Aeronautics of the United States Navy. The United States Air Force's Project RAND eventually released the report, but considered the satellite to be a tool for science, politics, and propaganda, rather than a potential military weapon.", "Sputnik 1 (or \"Satellite-1\", as it was known in the Soviet Union) was the first artificial Earth satellite. The Soviet Union launched it into an elliptical low Earth orbit on 4 October 1957. It orbited for three weeks before its batteries died. It was a 58-centimetre diameter polished metal sphere, with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses. Its radio signal was easily detectable even by radio amateurs, and the 65\u00b0 inclination and duration of its orbit made its flight path cover virtually the entire inhabited Earth. This surprise success precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race, a part of the Cold War.", "The first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. After that, the United States launched Explorer 1 in 1958. The first manned spaceflight was launched by the Soviet Union in 1961 with Vostok 1, carrying Yuri Gagarin. The United States launched its first manned space mission, Project Mercury, in 1961. The first space station was the Soviet Salyut 1, launched in 1971. China launched its first space station in 2011.", "The first artificial satellite was the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, which was launched on October 4, 1957. Sputnik 1 was a beach ball-sized satellite, about 22 in (58 cm) in diameter and weighing 183 lbs (83 kg). It had four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses back to Earth. The satellite remained in orbit for three weeks and was then pulled back into the atmosphere by gravity. It burned up on January 4, 1958.", "The first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched by the Soviets in 1957. Sputnik 1 was a satellite about the size of a beach ball, but it was an amazing accomplishment. Sputnik was the first man-made object to orbit the Earth. It was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957 and heralded the beginning of the Space Age. Its name translates to \"fellow traveler\" in English. Sputnik 1 sent signals back to Earth that could be tracked by radio stations around the world. The launch of Sputnik 1 came as a surprise to the world, and raised alarm in the United States. Americans worried that the Soviets were ahead in the space race."]}
{"sample_id": "50_2", "predicted_rewrite": ["What are the types of orbits of satellites?"], "predicted_response": ["An orbit is the gravitationally curved trajectory of an object, such as the trajectory of a planet around a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory, although it may also refer to a non-repeating trajectory. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Keplers laws of planetary motion. For most situations, orbital motion is adequately approximated by Newtonian mechanics, which explains gravity as a force obeying an inverse-square law. However, Albert Einsteins theory of general relativity, which accounts for gravity as due to curvature of spacetime, with orbits following geodesics, provides a more accurate calculation and understanding of the exact mechanics of orbital motion. General relativity is commonly approximated by a Galilean transformation, which is the simpler theory of relativity used in most applications of orbital mechanics outside of astronomy, and is the one most commonly taught in introductory physics and mechanics classes.", "The different types of orbits include equatorial, polar and inclined. The equatorial orbits are circular orbits that are located above the Earth's equator. The Polar orbits are orbits that pass over the north and south poles, and they are typically used by satellites that require constant surveillance of the earth's surface. Inclined orbits are orbits that are inclined at an angle to the equator, and these orbits are used by satellites that need to travel to multiple locations.", "The most common type of orbits are low Earth orbits (LEO), which are the orbits closest to Earth, at an altitude of 2,000 km (1,200 mi) or less above the Earth's surface. However, not all satellites use LEO orbits. Helios 2, the second fastest artificial object ever launched, is currently in a solar orbit at speed of 671,000 km/h (417,000 mph; 1.19 million ft/s). The most common types of orbits are as follows: Low Earth orbit (LEO): an orbit close to the Earth, with an altitude of 2,000 km (1,200 mi) or less and an orbital period of about 88 minutes. Medium Earth orbit (MEO): an orbit with an altitude of 20,200 km (12,600 mi) to 35,786 km (22,236 mi) and an orbital period (sidereal day) of 12 hours. Geosynchronous orbit (GEO): an orbit with an altitude of 35,786 km (22,236 mi) with an orbital period (sidereal day) of 24 hours. Geostationary orbit (GEOSTATIONARY): also known as geostationary Earth orbit (GEO), a circular geosynchronous orbit 35,786 km (22,236 mi) above the Earth's equator and following the direction of the Earth's rotation.", "The geocentric orbit is the first type of orbit. The geocentric orbit is a circular orbit around a central point. It is an imaginary line that the satellite follows. There are many offshoots of this orbit: the polar orbit, the low-Earth orbit and the geosynchronous orbit. A polar orbit is a geocentric orbit that passes over both the north and south poles of the earth. This is useful for imaging the earth because it allows satellites to see every part of it. A low-Earth orbit is a geocentric orbit that has an altitude of less than 2000 kilometers. This is the type of orbit that the International Space Station uses. A geosynchronous orbit is a geocentric orbit that is at the same speed as the Earth's rotation. This allows the satellite to appear to stay in the same position relative to the Earth. The heliocentric orbit is the second type of orbit. The heliocentric orbit is an orbit around the sun.", "An orbit is the path of an object around another object, such as the earth around the sun. The earth travels around the sun in an orbit. Orbits can be circular or elliptical. If the orbit is circular, the object returns to the same point in space after a certain amount of time. If the orbit is elliptical, the object never returns to the same point because the shape of the orbit is an oval. The sun lies at one of the two foci of the ellipse. A satellite is an object that orbits another object. For example, the moon and man-made satellites are satellites of the earth. The moon and some satellites have elliptical orbits. Some satellites have highly elliptical orbits that take them far out into space and then back very close to the earth. As a satellite orbits the earth, the earth's gravity keeps the satellite moving in a circle. The satellite has a gravitational force pulling it toward the earth. When the satellite is far from the earth, the gravitational force is weak and the satellite's speed is slow. When the satellite is closer to the earth, the gravitational force is stronger, and the satellite's speed is faster."]}

The following are some of the most important classes:", "A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth. Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications. There are about 2,000 communications satellites in Earths orbit, used by both private and government organizations. Many are in geostationary orbit 22,236 miles (35,785 km) above the equator, so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky, so the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track it. A military satellite is an artificial satellite used for a military purpose. The most common missions are intelligence gathering, navigation and military communications. The first military satellites were photographic reconnaissance missions. A navigation satellite is a satellite that is solely used to assist in navigation. The United States NAVSTAR Global Positioning System is the only fully operational GNSS. The Russian GLONASS and the planned European Galileo positioning systems are expected to be fully operational by 2020. A weather satellite is a type of satellite that is primarily used to monitor the weather and climate of the Earth. Satellites can be polar orbiting, covering the entire Earth asynchronously, or geostationary, hovering over the same spot on the equator. Meteorological satellites see more than clouds and cloud systems: city lights, fires, effects of pollution, auroras, sand and dust storms, snow cover, ice mapping, boundaries of ocean currents, energy flows, etc. Other types of environmental satellites include those designed to monitor the planet's vegetation, oceans, and ice.", "There are several types of satellites. Here are some of the important classes of satellites: Communications satellites: These satellites receive and send radio signals to TV, radio and telephone networks. Weather satellites: These satellites take regular pictures of the Earth that are used to predict the weather. Navigation satellites: They are used to pinpoint a person's exact location. Military satellites: These satellites are used by the military for spying and reconnaissance. Scientific satellites: These satellites are used to study the Earth and space.", "There are several important classes of satellites: Communications satellites relay radio and television signals. Earth observation satellites (e.g. meteorological satellites) collect data about the Earth. Weather satellites are Earth observation satellites that collect data specifically about the weather. Navigation satellites provide accurate positions for military and civilian use. Military surveillance satellites most of these are part of the USs Keyhole program. Space telescopes are satellites that orbit above the Earths atmosphere, and thus can collect information from the ultraviolet through the far infrared. The biggest example is the Hubble Space Telescope.", "The most common types of artificial satellites are classified by their orbit, which is the path their orbits around the Earth take. There are several types of satellite orbits, but the most commonly used ones are: LEO (Low Earth Orbit): These are the most common type of orbits. A LEO satellite is at an altitude of 2000 kilometres or less. At this distance, a satellite completes an orbit around the Earth in 90 minutes or less. It is difficult to send a lot of data through a LEO satellite. They are used for communication. MEO (Medium Earth Orbit): MEO satellites are at an altitude of 20,000 to 35,000 kilometres. A MEO satellite completes an orbit around the Earth in 2 to 12 hours. They are used for Global Positioning Systems (GPS). GEO (Geostationary Earth Orbit): GEO satellites are at an altitude of 35,786 kilometres. A GEO satellite follows the Earth's equator and completes an orbit around the Earth in 24 hours. This is the same time that it takes for the Earth to complete one rotation. They are used for communication."]}

It allows small electronic receivers to determine their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude) to within a few metres using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites. Satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated.", "Global Positioning System satellites broadcast their signals in space with a certain accuracy, but what you receive depends on additional factors, including satellite geometry, signal blockage, atmospheric conditions, and receiver design features/quality. On a good day with a clear view of the open sky, the GPS accuracy from your smartphone is about five meters, and it could be worse. However, with some simple steps you can achieve real-time positioning accuracy of about one meter.", "Satellite navigation systems provide location and time information in all weather conditions, anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more satellites. The systems are useful for navigation and for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver (satellite tracker). The most common system is the Global Positioning System (GPS), developed by the United States Department of Defense and managed by the United States Space Force. The Russian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) was developed contemporaneously with GPS, but suffered from incomplete coverage of the globe until the mid-2000s. GLONASS can be added to GPS devices which makes more satellites available and enabling positions to be fixed more quickly and accurately, to within 2 meters.", "Satellite navigation systems such as GPS and the Russian GLONASS are examples of space-based Positioning Systems (PBSs). They provide highly accurate location and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. The positioning data provided by a PBS is used in applications such as surveying, navigation, tracking, timing, and scientific research.", "Satellite navigation systems such as GPS and GLONASS are the most widely used in the world, but others do exist. These systems use satellite constellations to triangulate the position of a user. The user receives signals from at least four satellites in the constellation. The system then uses these to calculate the user's position in three dimensions. This can be done quite accurately, but requires a good view of the sky. For this reason, satellite navigation systems are very often used in conjunction with other technologies. For example, in the case of GPS, there are many GPS satellites, but the system works best when used with a ground-based augmentation system (GBAS) such as a local area augmentation system (LAAS). These systems work by using a network of ground stations to transmit signals to the user. The GPS receiver then calculates the user's position in a similar way."]}

Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution by natural selection is based on the idea that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors. Darwin maintained that new species are formed because some individuals in a species have features that make them better suited for their environment than others. These individuals are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on the features that enabled their success to the next generation. Over time, these small changes add up to large differences between the descendants of the original species and their ancestors, and new species form. In 1859, Darwin published his findings in On the Origin of Species. Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution is one of the most widely supported in the scientific community."]}

In fact, he was preceded by other evolutionary theorists, including Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Charles Lyell. However, he was the first to propose natural selection as the main driver of evolution. He also provided a large and diverse body of evidence in support of his theory. He developed his ideas on the origin of species during his travels aboard the HMS Beagle in the 1830s.", "In 1831 Darwin set off on a five-year voyage aboard the HMS Beagle as a naturalist who was tasked with collecting and cataloguing animal and plant species. He observed that the various species inhabiting a certain region shared the same characteristics. He also found fossils of sea creatures in the Andes Mountains. All of these observations led him to believe that the Earth had changed over time and that species had adapted to fit their environment over time through a process that he called natural selection.", "In the early 1800s, European naturalists began to wonder how the species of the world were related and how they had changed over time. The idea of evolution was not new, but Charles Darwin turned this idea into a scientifically verifiable theory that could explain the origin of life. Darwin was inspired by a trip to the Galapagos Islands, where he observed finches with beaks of different shapes and sizes. He used these different beaks to understand how the birds adapted to their environment. To explain his observations, Darwin developed the theory of natural selection.", "During the voyage of the Beagle, Darwin developed his initial theory of natural selection, which he elaborated in his later works, including The Origin of Species. A scientific paper outlining his theory, written in 1842, was sent to a fellow naturalist, the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, for comment. Darwin, who was deeply impressed by Malthus's Essay, thought that Malthus's idea of population growth might explain the mechanism of evolution. He wrote in his notebook: \"Malthus on orchids. Rheas. Lyell on species. Malthus on man. No creator. All species have arisen from other species.\" Around this time, Darwin read Malthus's Essay on Population and Thomas Robert Malthus's Essay on Population, which argued that human populations tend to increase faster than their food supply, and that unless they are checked, populations will outgrow their resources, leading to a population crash."]}

Darwin also realized that species produce more offspring than can survive. He developed the idea of natural selection as an explanation of how this evolutionary change takes place.", "Sexual reproduction is the process by which two individuals of the opposite sex produce offspring. The two individuals, one male and one female, each contribute half of the genetic makeup of the offspring. If a mutation occurs in one of the parents, that mutation can be passed on to the offspring. In asexual reproduction, an organism makes a copy of itself. In this process, an individual produces an offspring that is genetically identical to itself. Organisms that reproduce asexually can pass on beneficial mutations to their offspring.", "Evolution requires mutation and selection in order to happen. Both sexual and asexual reproduction can cause mutations, but only sexual reproduction can cause recombination, which is the mixing of genetic material from two different parents. While both sexual and asexual reproduction are viable methods of reproduction, sexual reproduction is more likely to produce offspring with genetic variation, which is required for evolution to happen.", "Asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction in which a single organism or cell makes a copy of itself. This reproduction occurs without the need for a partner, or sperm and egg. This can be seen in many plants, single-celled organisms, fungi, and even certain animals. Asexual reproduction occurs by mitosis, in which a cell divides into two identical cells. Sexual reproduction involves two parents. The process of meiosis creates gametes, or sex cells, which contain half the genetic material of the parent cell. After the two gametes fuse, the offspring contains half of its genetic code from each parent, just like the parent cell.", "In asexual reproduction, the offspring has one parent and receives one set of genes from that parent. Although it may sound like a good idea to have offspring without a mate, it really is not. In fact, asexual reproduction is known as \"the slow road to extinction.\" Asexual reproduction is not a good strategy to use because it allows less variation in genes. In sexual reproduction, two organisms reproduce by exchanging genetic material to produce offspring. This means that the offspring has two parents and receives two sets of genes.

Fossilization is a process that takes place over many years. A fossil is a record of the history of life on Earth. It is an example of a long-ago organism that was preserved in a rock. Fossils are created when an organism dies and is buried in sediment. Over time, the sediment becomes rock and preserves the organism or the organism's tracks. The oldest fossils are of single-celled organisms.", "Fossil evidence is useful for showing the transition between species over time. In the case of fish, for example, the present-day descendants of the lobe-finned fish are the lungfish, which have lungs, and the amphibians, which have both lungs and gills. Fossils show that there were animals that had both lungs and gills, as well as animals with lungs but no gills, before the animals that are thought to have evolved from these animals.", "Paleontology, the study of fossils, contributed to the theory of evolution by providing evidence of the earth's age and past life forms. However, the idea of evolution from a common ancestor didn't arise from the fossil record alone. Darwin had read Malthus' Essay on the Principle of Population, which explained that populations grow exponentially, doubling every 25 years. Malthus argued that this growth would be checked by famine, disease, and war, and that populations would eventually stabilize.

Yoga is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophical traditions. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Among the most well-known types of yoga are Hatha yoga and Raja yoga. The origins of yoga have been speculated to date back to pre-Vedic Indian traditions; it is mentioned in the Rigveda, but most likely developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, in ancient India's ascetic and \u015brama\u1e47a movements. The chronology of earliest texts describing yoga-practices is unclear, varyingly credited to Hindu Upanishads and Buddhist P\u0101li Canon, probably of third century BCE or later. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from the first half of the 1st millennium CE, but only gained prominence in the West in the 20th century. Hatha yoga texts emerged around the 11th century with origins in tantra. Yoga gurus from India later introduced yoga to the West, following the success of Swami Vivekananda in the late 19th and early 20th century. In the 1980s, yoga became popular as a system of physical exercise across the Western world. Yoga in Indian traditions, however, is more than physical exercise, it has a meditative and spiritual core. One of the six major orthodox schools of Hinduism is also called Yoga, which has its own epistemology and metaphysics, and is closely related to Hindu Samkhya philosophy. Many studies have tried to determine the effectiveness of yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer, schizophrenia, asthma, and heart disease. The results of these studies have been mixed and inconclusive, with cancer studies suggesting none to unclear effectiveness, and others suggesting yoga may reduce risk factors and aid in a patient's psychological healing process.", "Yoga is an ancient Indian practice that has grown popular in the West in recent years.

Yoga can be defined as a systematic philosophy and an integrated system of education for the body, mind, and spirit. Yoga is a way of life. It is a practical aid, not a religion. It helps achieve communion with God. Yoga is not a new invention. It is, in fact, a very ancient Indian body of knowledge.

Some people take up yoga to relieve stress. Others use it to relax and unwind. If you\u2019re looking for a way to reduce your stress levels, yoga might be the answer. Recent studies have shown that yoga can help reduce stress and anxiety. It can also enhance your mood and overall sense of well-being.", "According to Harvard Medical School, yoga can reduce stress because of the mental component of the practice. The mental component of yoga can help you learn how to be more mindful and aware of the present moment without judgment. Mindfulness is when you increase your awareness of the present moment. In other words, you stop thinking about the past or future and focus on the here and now. This type of mental training may help you learn how to be more mindful in your everyday life. The physical component of yoga may help reduce stress as well. Yoga may help increase heart rate variability (HRV). HRV is the amount of time between each heartbeat. A higher HRV may help lower your stress levels. The physical component of yoga may also help reduce stress because it may help increase the amount of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. GABA is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate nerve activity in the brain. Low levels of GABA have been linked to depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Yoga may help increase GABA levels by increasing serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood, appetite, and sleep.

The bone marrow is a spongy material in the middle of bones which produces the blood cells for the body. The bone marrow produces red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Mature red blood cells are produced through a process called erythropoiesis. Red blood cells are created from a cell in the bone marrow called a stem cell. The stem cell divides and creates a cell called a proerythroblast. A proerythroblast is a large cell which contains large amounts of hemoglobin. The cell then divides and produces an erythroblast. The erythroblast is also a large cell, but has less hemoglobin than a proerythroblast. The cell continues to divide and produces a reticulocyte. Reticulocytes are still immature red blood cells which contain RNA. The RNA is not needed by the mature cell and is discarded, leaving a mature red blood cell. The production of red blood cells is controlled by the kidneys, which release a hormone called erythropoietin. The erythropoietin is released when the body senses that the oxygen content of the blood is low.
