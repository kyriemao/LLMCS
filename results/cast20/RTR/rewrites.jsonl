The Grocery Manufacturers Association and other food industry groups argue that GMO's are safe, and that mandatory labeling would raise food costs for consumers.", "GMO labeling is widely popular among US consumers. However, it's still not required by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Food companies in the US do not need to include this information on product packaging.  In the past, GMO labeling has been defeated in the US because of concerns over higher costs for producers and consumers.", "The European Union (EU) regulates GMOs the same way as any other food, with the exception that all food that contains GMO or ingredients derived from GMO must be labeled.  In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) generally considers GMOs to be safe, and requires safety testing only for foods that contain genes from known allergens. The US does not require labels for food containing GMOs, although the FDA does allow companies to label products as non-GMO.", "In the European Union, the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment is regulated by Directive 2001/18/EC. Directive 2001/18/EC applies to the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment and commercial use, which means it covers field trials as well as the placing on the market of GMOs (including imports) in the form of products or products containing GMOs. This Directive is complemented by specific Directives which regulate the placing on the market of GMOs as food or feed, and the cultivation of GMOs as well as the import and export of GMOs. In the United States, there has been a debate over whether genetically engineered foods should be labeled. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has maintained that genetically engineered foods can be substantially equivalent to conventional foods and need not be labeled. In 2016, the United States Department of Agriculture finalized rules requiring GMO foods to be labeled.", "In the EU and the US, food labels are not required to disclose GM content. In the US, all GM foods must be approved by the FDA. The FDA's position is that the fact that a food is GM or not has no bearing on its safety or nutrition.  At the same time, the FDA encourages companies to label foods that are GM or not.  On the other hand, in the EU, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approves GM crops, and labeling is mandatory when the GM content is over 0.9%.  This can be contrasted with the US, where labeling is voluntary and the threshold is 5%.  The EFSA and FDA have approved GM crops that are currently in commercial use, including soybean, maize, cotton, and canola.  While it is true that all GM crops approved in the US have also been approved in the EU, the EU has strict labeling requirements while the US has none.  There is strong disagreement in the scientific community whether labeling GM food is a useful exercise. The pros and cons of GM labeling have been reviewed.  Some argue that labeling should be mandatory and is necessary for the consumer to exercise informed choice.  On the other hand, others argue that labeling is not required because all approved GM crops are safe for consumption.  One of the key arguments for labeling is that it can help distinguish GM from non-GM crops, which can be important for people allergic to a specific GM crop."]}

A positive result in a GMO test indicates the presence of the DNA of a particular GMO in the sample. The test does not indicate the amount of a particular GMO in the sample. A positive result does not necessarily mean the food contains the protein produced by the GMO.", "The DNA-based method uses a PCR reaction to amplify a part of the target DNA. The DNA is first extracted from a sample by a process called nucleic acid extraction. The DNA is then amplified by PCR. The amplified DNA is then analyzed by a method, such as gel electrophoresis, to determine if the GMO is present. DNA based methods can detect GMOs in all food, animal feed and in the environment.", "DNA-based detection looks for a part of the foreign DNA inserted in a GMO. For technical reasons, certain DNA sequences are shared by several GMOs. In most cases, the DNA techniques detect the DNA sequence present in a transgenic plant, but not the transgenic plant itself, because this DNA sequence can also be present in non-transgenic varieties, e.g. by cross-pollination. DNA-based detection methods are sensitive, but also susceptible to false positive results. A positive result, if confirmed by an independent method, indicates that the GMO is present, but a negative result does not exclude the presence of a GMO and needs to be confirmed by a different method.", "DNA-based methods use a PCR based method, which uses the specific sequence of the transgenic DNA to amplify the gene and detect it. This method is more sensitive, but can only detect GMOs for which the transgenic sequence is known.  The Basic GMO Screen is a multiplex PCR that detects the presence of transgenic DNA from the most common transgenic crops: corn, soy, canola, cotton, sugarbeet, and alfalfa.  A positive result in this test indicates that the DNA is from a GMO, and further testing is required to determine the specific GMO.", "The DNA-based detection is usually done by PCR. A PCR reaction needs a DNA fragment of the GMO to be detected. Such DNA fragments are called PCR primers. Usually two primers are used, which together form a pair of primers. The pair of primers is chosen such that the PCR product is unique for the GMO to be detected. If a GMO is detected via a pair of primers, it can be concluded that the food sample is not free of the GMO. The GMO will have to be confirmed by an independent method. This method is called construct-specific detection. It is most often used to test for the presence of a GMO in a food sample."]}

Bees are a great help to us, pollinating many of the plants we depend on. Without bees, we wouldn\u2019t have many of the foods we enjoy, including apples and almonds. Bees are social insects and live together in colonies. A colony of bees is made up of three types of bees: workers, drones, and a queen. The queen is the only female bee that lays eggs, and she can lay up to 1,500 eggs a day.", "Bees are insects that are found all over the world. There are about 20,000 species of bees. Some of them produce honey and beeswax. Bees are important to the environment because they pollinate flowers. Without bees, many plants would die and there would be less food for animals. Bees are found in most parts of the world, except in extreme environments such as deserts and the Arctic. Some bees live alone, but the majority of bees live in colonies. A bee colony consists of one queen bee, a few hundred male bees called drones, and at least 20,000 female worker bees. Bees have a barbed stinger that they use to protect themselves.

Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and it has the same relative sweetness as granulated sugar. Honey has a much higher viscosity than granulated sugar though. This is because the monosaccharides in honey attract water and act like magnets to keep the water from evaporating. If you've ever tried to dry out honey that has crystallized, you know how hard it is to get the honey to release water.", "The reason honey doesn't spoil is because it is low in moisture, it is acidic and bacteria can't grow in it. The reason that honey has a low moisture content is because bees make it that way. When they make honey they add an enzyme that changes the sugar into a form that preserves the honey. This enzyme is called glucose oxidase. It is what give honey its unique flavor.", "Honey is full of sugar, which makes it very difficult for bacteria to grow. Because of this, honey can last almost forever. It is a very long-lasting food. This fact is true of all kinds of honey. It is true of honey that is raw, organic, and unfiltered. It is also true of regular honey you can get at any grocery store.", "Honey is a natural food that contains vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, water and carbohydrates. Honey is primarily composed of fructose, glucose, and water. Honey also contains trace quantities of several vitamins and minerals, including magnesium, iron and vitamin C. The acidic pH of honey is the result of the presence of organic acids in the mixture, including gluconic acid, which is produced by the conversion of glucose from the breakdown of glucose. Other organic acids include citric acid and formic acid. These organic acids are responsible for the acidic taste of honey and are also responsible for the low pH of honey, which has an average pH of 3.9. The acidic pH of honey helps to reduce the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms in the honey so that it does not spoil.

VCs invest in the startup in exchange of equity in the company. This is usually in the form of Preferred Stock. Convertible Preferred Stock: These preferred stocks can be converted into equity. The conversion can happen at a fixed price or at a future price. The conversion can take place after a certain time period, when the company raises a new round of financing or when the company gets acquired.", "There are several different types of instruments that VCs use when investing in a startup: 1. Preferred Stock - VCs will invest in a startup via the purchase of preferred stock, usually by way of a purchase agreement. 2. Convertible Debt - VCs will sometimes invest in a startup via the purchase of convertible debt, usually by way of a convertible note purchase agreement. 3. SAFE - VCs will sometimes invest in a startup via the purchase of a SAFE, a Simple Agreement for Future Equity. See our post on the SAFE. 4. Other Equity Securities - VCs may invest in a startup via the purchase of other types of equity securities, such as warrants, rights, or options. 5. Convertible Equity - A relatively new type of investment is the convertible equity, in which a VC will make an investment in a startup via the purchase of convertible equity. See our post on the convertible equity.", "Venture capitalists use a number of different instruments to invest in companies. The three main types are: Common stock \u2014 This is the most basic type of stock. Common stock represents a share of ownership in a company and gives investors voting rights. Preferred stock \u2014 Preferred stock is a hybrid between common stock and a bond. Preferred stockholders have rights that common stockholders don't have. They're paid a fixed dividend and have a preference for receiving the proceeds from a sale or liquidation. They also have certain rights to vote on a company's policies. Convertible debt \u2014 This is a hybrid between debt and equity. Convertible debt acts like a loan in that the company pays the investor interest. However, the investor has the option of converting the debt into equity after a certain period. If the company is successful, the investor's return can be larger than if they had invested in common stock.", "There are a number of different types of investment instruments that venture capitalists use to make investments. The most common are common stock, preferred stock and convertible debt.  Common Stock: When venture capitalists invest in a company, they typically make the investment in the form of common stock.  When a VC makes an investment in common stock, they receive one vote per share of stock they own.  The company's common stock has no fixed dividend, so there are no guaranteed payments to the holders of the stock.  Preferred Stock:  In addition to common stock, venture capitalists may invest in preferred stock.  Preferred stock is a special class of stock that has certain preferences over common stock.  These preferences include:  o  The right to receive dividends before the holders of common stock.  o  The right to receive a liquidation preference if the company is liquidated.  o  The right to vote on certain important corporate matters.  A venture capitalist may also negotiate for other preferences, including the right to appoint a director to the company's board of directors.  Convertible Debt:  Another type of investment instrument that venture capitalists use is convertible debt.  Convertible debt is a loan that can be converted into stock at a future date.  The conversion of the debt into stock typically happens upon the company's next financing round.  The advantage of convertible debt is that it allows the company to defer paying interest and principal on the loan until the next financing round.  The downside of convertible debt is that the venture capitalist's return on the investment is uncertain.  The venture capitalist must rely on the next financing round to determine the value of the loan.  The venture capitalist also has to accept that the value of the loan may be less than the original amount of the loan."]}

After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe and with the conquest of the Balkans, the Ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror.

A prey is an animal that is hunted and killed by another animal for food.", "Predation is a biological interaction where a predator (a hunting animal) kills and eats its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation always results in the death of its prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasites prey on their host and then lay their eggs on it, for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live, or upon its death; this is called parasitism. The key characteristic of predation is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores (such as earthworms) simply eat dead organic material present in the soil, and have no direct impact on the \"donor\" organism. Selective pressures imposed on one another often leads to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in various antipredator adaptations. Ways of classifying predation include grouping by trophic level or diet, by specialization, and by the predator's interaction with prey. A true predator is one that kills and eats another living thing. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators.", "A predator is an organism that hunts and eats other organisms.

Predators rely on prey for their nourishment, while prey rely on predators as a means of controlling their population size. This relationship is a complicated one, as each party has its own needs and goals. Predators want to eat prey in order to survive, while prey want to avoid being eaten.", "A predator is an organism that feeds on another organism. The prey is an organism that is hunted, or killed, by the predator. Predators have adaptations that allow them to capture prey. Predators include lions, tigers, and wolves.

They are neither entirely beneficial nor entirely harmful to their prey, which means that they neither entirely benefit nor entirely harm the prey's population. In order to understand this relationship, it is important to understand the basics of plant nutrition. Plants require nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in order to grow. Predatory plants often grow in nitrogen-poor environments, such as bogs, and as a result are unable to procure enough nitrogen to grow.

The following are some of the many factors which can influence predator-prey dynamics:", "The relationship between predator and prey is a key aspect of the interactions between predators, prey and their environments, and is central to the understanding of ecology. When the population of predators is high, the population of prey is reduced. This, in turn, can reduce the number of predators.", "There are two ways that we can define predator-prey relationships. We can look at them on a broader scale as in the case of wolves and elk. We can also look at predator-prey relationships in a very narrow context, such as the relationship between a particular kind of wolf and a particular kind of elk. On a broader scale, predator-prey relationships follow a fairly predictable pattern. If there is a large increase of wolves, the population of elk will decrease. If there is a decrease in the number of wolves, the population of elk will increase. This is called the predator-prey cycle. Within this cycle, there is a relationship between the predator and prey populations. When one population increases, the other population decreases."]}

It evolved into an actual sport when enthusiasts started it using a downhill form of skiing known as slalom.", "Snowboarding began as an off-season training exercise for surfers and skateboarders. In the mid-1960s, an American surfer named Sherman Poppen strapped two skis together and created a \"snurfer\" so his daughter could get a feel for surfing while away from the ocean. The snurfer became a toy in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and people began to compete on the Snurfing Competition Circuit, which was sponsored by the Brunswick Corporation (maker of the Snurfer).", "The invention of modern snowboarding has been attributed to two men, Sherman Poppen and Dimitrije Milovich.

In the early 1990s skateboarding was the fastest growing sport in the world, and it was snowboarding that introduced a whole new approach to the snow. Snowboarding was born of many ideas, but the most important was that it became the first mass participatory sport to have an alternative attitude. Snowboarding's roots can be traced to the early 1960s when a group of surfers in the northern United States and southern Canada, who were looking for an alternative to surfing during the long, frigid winters, created the first snowboards. The surfers took the principles of surfing and applied them to the snow. The sport was slow to evolve because it was difficult to produce a board that could be ridden on snow."]}

Snowboarding developed in the United States in the 1960s as people across the country began to seek out new winter activities. One of the earliest pioneers was Sherman Poppen, a businessman from Muskegon, Michigan, who invented the \"snurfer\" (a term coined by his wife Nancy) in the mid-1960s as a toy for his daughters. Snurfing was originally conceived as a sort of dry land alternative to surfing. It gained immediate popularity among teenagers. Poppen licensed the idea to a manufacturer, Brunswick Corporation, that sold about a million snurfers over the next decade. The sport's popularity was boosted by the 1978 release of a film, \"The Endless Winter,\" which, although fictional, introduced the sport to a wider audience, particularly in Europe. Initially, snowboarding was not accepted by most ski areas because they were concerned about liability, skier numbers and the environment. However, throughout the 1990s, snowboarding became more mainstream, and more resorts allowed snowboarders on their slopes."]}

The rivalry between the Steelers and Ravens is not just based on geographical location, but it has been fueled by the transfer of players between the teams. Art Modell moved the Cleveland Browns and many of their players to Baltimore to help establish the new team.

That's how the Deadhead community grew \u2014 by trading tapes of their live shows.", "This was possible because the band allowed taping at their concerts. These recordings were circulated free of charge among fans in a practice known as \"tapers\". The tapes were then circulated in a fashion similar to cassette tape trading, but with a few differences. The most obvious difference was that there was no money exchanged, and no profit motive. The tapers were encouraged to share their recordings with as many other people as possible, so a network developed to distribute the recordings. Another major difference was that the band gave their permission. They did not just allow taping at their concerts, they encouraged it. Tapers were allowed to set up their microphones in a special section near the stage. Deadheads who made recordings were called \"tapers\". The band allowed their fans to tape shows because they believed that it was a way for fans to share in the band's music. They also believed that it was one of the best ways to promote more people attending their concerts. It was not uncommon for the band to allow several different audience tapers to record the same show. A taper would record a concert, and then the tape would circulate from person to person until it ended up in the hands of someone who was able to make copies.

This is because a system that performs well on one type of collection may not perform as well on another. The TREC collections have been carefully developed over the last 20 years to be just such a representative collection. As we discuss above, the TREC collections are much more than just a set of documents with relevance judgments. They are designed to test the effectiveness of retrieval systems on a variety of different types of queries, and on a variety of different types of documents and collections.", "Test Collections  A test collection is a set of data that is used in information retrieval experiments. The data typically consists of a large number of documents and a set of queries. The test collection is used to evaluate the performance of an information retrieval system.  The TREC program has produced a number of test collections, each of which was created with a specific purpose in mind. The test collections have been useful not only for evaluating IR systems, but also for allowing the IR community to conduct research on the evaluation process itself.  The test collections are usually accompanied by a set of relevance judgements, which assign a relevance level to each document for each query. The relevance level can be binary, i.e., each document is either relevant or non-relevant, or it can be graded, so there are multiple levels of relevance. This information is used to evaluate the performance of IR systems on the test collection.", "1. The test collection is a set of documents that you want to search. In order to be able to test different search engines and algorithms, you need a set of documents that is big enough to contain at least a few relevant documents for a given query. The test collection is often composed of a set of documents that are related to the same topic. For example, a test collection for a web search engine could be composed of documents from a specific domain.2. The test queries are the queries that are used to search the test collection. For example, in the TREC web track, the test queries are general queries that are likely to be entered by users into a web search engine. The test queries are often created after an analysis of real queries that are entered into a search engine. They can also be created manually. The test queries are generally used to search the test collection and to measure the effectiveness of a search engine.3. The relevance judgments are the set of judgments of the relevance of documents in the test collection for the test queries. Relevance judgments are often called relevance assessments. For each test query, there is a set of documents in the test collection that are considered relevant to the query. This set is called the relevant set. For example, in the TREC web track, a relevant document is one that would be useful to a user who enters a query. This can be a document that answers the query, or that provides useful information about the query topic. In order to effectively compare search engines, a set of relevance judgments is used that is made by the same person or group of people. This is called a common set of relevance judgments. It is also important for the relevance judgments to be judged carefully. For example, if the relevance judgments are made by one person, then it is important for that person not to be biased toward any search engine. However, a set of relevance judgments judged by one person is generally better than a set of relevance judgments judged by many people, because there is less disagreement between the judgments."]}

One general limitation of clickthrough data is that it can be biased by the presentation of the results, such as the order or how many results are shown. In addition, clickthrough data can be used to calculate the click-through rate (CTR). Another way to gather online metrics is to utilize implicit feedback and explicit feedback. Implicit feedback is gathered through observing a user's actions (such as clicks and the amount of time spent on a page). Explicit feedback is gathered when the user is asked to rate the usefulness of a result. This is often done by asking the user to rate the result on a scale from 1-5. In addition to the rating, the user is sometimes asked to provide a textual justification of the rating.", "Online metrics can be collected in real-time or near real-time, and gives a good idea of how search systems are performing as they are used by customers. Online metrics can be collected passively, but this method often has a major drawback. By passively collecting data, no information can be gathered on the users' perception of the results returned by the search system. There are several methods of actively collecting metrics, which are generally easier to interpret.
