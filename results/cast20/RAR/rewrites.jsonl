Most are controlled by switches on the garage wall, as well as by remote controls carried by the owner. The electric overhead garage door opener was invented by C.G. Johnson in 1926 in Hartford City, Indiana. In many homes, the garage door opener is the heaviest appliance utilized daily and has the most moving parts. In addition, it is under the largest amount of tension of any device in the home. Garage door opener systems consist of a power unit that contains the electric motor. The power unit attaches to a track. A trolley connected to an arm that attaches to the top of the garage door slides back and forth on the track, thus opening and closing the garage door. The trolley is pulled along the track by a chain, belt, or screw that turns when the motor is operated. A quick-release mechanism is attached to the trolley to allow the garage door to be disconnected from the opener for manual operation during a power failure or in case of emergency. Garage door openers have been in use for decades, and the technology hasn't changed much in the last 30 years. However, there is a wide range of options and features available, which can make finding the perfect opener for you difficult.", "The first sign that your garage door opener is going bad is a slow response.

There is an advantage in providing the world with better food access, but more research is needed to explore all the ramifications of genetic modification. To help you decide where you stand, it is important to take a look at both the pros and cons of genetically modified foods. Pro: Higher Crop Yields. One of the biggest advantages of genetically modified crops is that they have higher crop yields than traditional crops. This means that there is less of a risk of a widespread famine or food shortage when there is a large population to feed. Pro: Lower Prices. When there are higher crop yields, it means that you can get more crops from every acre of land. This means that the cost of growing a crop is lower. When the cost is lower, farmers can pass those savings on to their customers. This makes it easier for people to afford the food that they need to survive. Pro: Disease Resistance. When you genetically modify crops, you can make them more resistant to the diseases that might cause them to become damaged or die. If you can make the crops more resistant to disease, it means that you can grow more crops in a given area. This can help with the increased demand for food, which is expected to double by the year 2050. Con: Health Risks. One of the biggest disadvantages of genetically modified foods is that they may present unexpected health risks. There is a chance that people may have allergic reactions to the engineered genes that have been inserted into the food. The changes in the food could also have an effect on the nutritional value of the crops. Con: Environmental Risks. There are concerns that genetically modified foods may have a negative impact on the environment. There are a number of ways that these crops could become a threat. For example, the modified crops may cross-breed with traditional crops, which could potentially create a strain that is difficult to control. The crops could also have a negative effect on the insects and animals that are in the area."]}

The objective of this project is to develop coexistence scenarios with comprehensive cost-benefit analyses of the different options to be put in place to ensure coexistence. The results of this project will be presented to decision makers, farmers and the general public.  The Co-Extra project is coordinated by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland."]}

The term does not cover organisms that have been modified by conventional plant breeding methods, such as hybridization. Any organism that has been modified by the techniques of modern biotechnology is a GMO. However, the term GMO is often used specifically for genetically modified plants, which are widely grown in the United States. In Europe, the term GMP (genetically modified plant) is sometimes used. The American Medical Association (AMA) recommends that GMO and GMP be used as a legal term, not as a scientific term, \"because of the diversity of potential modifications.\"", "When testing for contamination, the GM strain is usually the variable, whereas the non-GM strain is the control.  The sensitivity of detection methods is different for each gene, so the number of positives may vary considerably. The most common \"control genes\" are those that confer resistance against antibiotics, but in individual cases even those genes are not suitable and a different gene must be used. The \"gold standard\" of detection is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can detect as little as one copy of a gene.  PCR is used to detect any type of gene, even those that were never inserted into any GMO."]}

The PCR is a reaction that amplifies a DNA sequence by repeatedly copying it. A sample is treated with enzymes that break it down into individual DNA molecules. One of the DNA strands, the template, is copied many times in a process that requires four things: a template, a set of special enzymes (the DNA polymerase), special building blocks of DNA (the nucleotides), and primers. The primers are short pieces of DNA that are complementary to the ends of the part of the template that we wish to amplify. The enzymes are able to bind to the DNA at the end of the primer, and then start building a new DNA molecule, using the template as a guide. The new DNA is made of the building blocks, the nucleotides. The new DNA molecule will have a sequence identical to the template.", "In GMO analysis, when the analysis target is known, the detection can be done with PCR. In the case of DNA-based detection, the construct-specific detection works by isolating the relevant sequences that are specific to that construct, and detecting their presence and quantity in the sample.  The most common detection method is based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  The sample material is ground into a fine powder and then combined with an appropriate buffer solution. The DNA is isolated and purified from the powder, then amplified using PCR. This is done with a set of specific primers. These primers are designed to bind to the target sequence in the DNA and start the amplification of this sequence.

Bees are found on every continent except Antarctica. There are about 20,000 species of bees, which are divided into nine recognized families. Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and are presently considered a clade, called Anthophila. There are over 16,000 known species of bees in seven to nine recognized families, though many are undescribed and the actual number is probably higher. They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants. Bees are an important part of their ecosystems because they pollinate plants that other organisms, including humans, use as food. Many other organisms, especially birds and bats, also consume nectar and pollen. In the past, humans used beeswax to make candles and soap, as well as royal jelly to promote health and longevity. Bees are essential as pollinators of food crops and as pollinators of wildflowers and other plants.

Bees pollinate our food, flowers and much of the wild plants and trees that provide food and habitat for other wildlife. There are approximately 20,000 species of bees in the world. Bees are insects. Like all insects, bees have six legs, three body parts (head, thorax and abdomen), a pair of antennae and compound eyes. The honey bee is the only insect that produces food eaten by humans. There are seven species of honey bee, but only one is domesticated. Bees are cold-blooded and cannot regulate their own body temperature. They generate heat by vibrating their flight muscles. Honey bees live in colonies where the workers sting intruders as a form of defense and alarming the hive of danger. Worker honey bees are female, live for about 6 weeks and do all the work. They make up 98% of the hive population. Honey bees have barbed stingers, which lodge in the skin of their victim when they sting. The stinger and poison sac are attached to muscles, which pump poison into the victim. When the bee tries to fly away, the muscles are torn from the body of the bee and the bee dies. The worker bee has five eyes, three small ones on top of the head and two big ones in front. Bees have been producing honey in the same way for 150 million years. Bees fly at an average 15 miles per hour, but some have been clocked at over 20 mph. A honey bee can fly for up to six miles, and as high as 5,000 feet.

Honey bees communicate with one another by dancing.", "Bees are insects and their order is called Hymenoptera (membrane wings). There are over 20,000 species of bees and they vary in size and colour. The largest species is Megachile pluto (a leafcutter bee) with a length of 39mm, and the smallest is Perdita minima (a fairy bee) with a length of 2mm. Bees can see ultraviolet light and they use it to find flowers and detect ultraviolet patterns on petals. Bees have five eyes, three small ones on their face and two large ones in the middle. Bees can only see in shades of yellow and blue. Their colour vision is more sensitive than that of humans. Bees have two pairs of wings and they can fly at a speed of about 25km/h. Bees live in colonies and there are three types of bees in a colony: a queen bee, female worker bees, and male drones. The queen is the only fertile female in the colony and she lays eggs, while the worker bees build the nest, look after the young, guard the nest, and collect nectar and pollen. The drones are infertile males and they mate with the queen. Bees communicate with each other using a series of dances. A waggle dance is used to communicate the direction and distance of a source of food. A round dance is used to communicate the distance of a source of food. A tremble dance is used to communicate the urgency of a source of food. Bees produce honey from the nectar of flowers and they use it as a source of food. Honey is made from nectar, which is collected by the worker bees and stored in a special stomach. The worker bees chew the nectar until it turns into honey and then regurgitate it. Bees produce beeswax from eight wax glands on their abdomen. They produce beeswax in the form of tiny scales, which they use to build the comb in the hive. Bees have a barbed stinger and when they sting, the stinger is left behind in the victim's skin. The bee dies after it has stung.

Convertible debt is a loan that can later be converted into shares of stock in the company. In addition, the company may be able to negotiate a discount on the price of these shares. This allows the seed investor to receive some form of compensation in the event that the company does not perform well and the investor does not wish to convert the debt into equity."]}

In the 19th century, the term was used by Ottoman officials to describe the different religious communities present in the Ottoman Empire. The system was widely used to assign different peoples to different classifications under the Ottoman rule. Before the Conquest of Constantinople, its application was limited to the Eastern Mediterranean area, especially to the Rum Millet, which covered the Christian population of the Balkans, the Levant and Anatolia. The Ottoman government supported the Millet system as an attempt to divide its subjects according to their religion, rather than integrating them as Ottomanists.", "The millet system is a system of juridical and administrative separation of peoples practicing different religions within a country, in which individuals were given to profess their own religion and manage their own community affairs according to their own laws. This system was established in the Ottoman Empire during the 15th century, and the millet-i Rum (Ottoman Greek millet) became the predominant form of organisation in the Balkans and the Middle East. Although the term \"millet\" has been used in the Ottoman Empire for non-Muslim communities, it has no connection to the concept of nation-state, \"millet\" does not mean \"nation\" or \"people\".

Social networks were created as a way for users to connect with other people and share information. While this is a beneficial aspect of social networks, it also poses several privacy risks. The more information users share with other people, the more information they hand over to companies and other entities. This information can be used in a variety of ways, from selling it to advertisers to selling the social network itself. The more information users share, the more likely it is that the information will be public, and the less likely it is that it will be private. Cloud computing, on the other hand, is a relatively new technology that is becoming increasingly popular.Cloud computing is a way of storing and accessing information on a network of computers instead of a single computer. The cloud is a way of storing data remotely, so that it can be accessed from anywhere. In other words, it is a way of storing data on the internet. It is a highly decentralized system in which each individual user is responsible for their own data. This means that the data is not stored centrally, and that the data is not shared. Instead, it is stored in individual computers. This means that if one computer is compromised, the rest of the network is unaffected."]}

The sport of snowboarding began in 1965 when Sherman Poppen, an engineer in Muskegon, Michigan, invented a toy for his daughters by fastening two skis together and attaching a rope to one end so he would have some control as they stood on the board and glided downhill. The invention of his \"Snurfer\" (for \"snow\" and \"surfer\") caught the eye of a businessman who mass-produced and sold the toy in ski shops. This toy enjoyed modest success in the market until 1977, when Poppen licensed the product to a manufacturer called Brunswick. By the late 1970s, a handful of snowboarders were frequenting the ski slopes in the United States, but were often banned for being too \"disruptive.\"", "Snowboarding is a winter sport that came about in the 1960s as an offshoot of surfing and skateboarding. The first snowboards were made of wooden planks and metal edges. They were hard to steer and control, but that didn't stop people from trying. In 1965, Sherman Poppen, a resident of Muskegon, Michigan, took a Snurfer -- a toy that looked like a sled with a rope attached to the front -- out on the slopes with his daughters. He and his wife, Nancy, saw the potential in the toy, and he designed a more stable version of it with a rope for steering. Snurfers were mass-produced and sold in toy stores. In 1980, the first snowboarding competition was held in Vermont. Snowboarding became popular in the 1980s.", "Back in the older days, people used to slide down mountains on other things, like pieces of wood or metal. But, nobody really knows who first thought of using a snowboard. Some people say that it was an engineer from New Jersey called Sherman Poppen in 1965 who came up with the idea. He was looking for ways to entertain his daughter in the snow and so he tied two skis together and used a rope to steer them. His daughter and her friends loved it, and they called it the \"Snurfer.\" This name is a combination of the words \"snow\" and \"surfer.\" Poppen got a toy company to start selling them, and they soon became very popular. Others say that Jake Burton Carpenter had the idea for a snowboard back in 1977. He worked for a company that made waterskiing equipment and he thought it would be a great idea to make a board that people could use for skiing in the snow. Around this time, a guy called Tom Sims was also making his own snowboards. He was a surfer who wanted to try snowboarding and so he made his own board out of a piece of wood.", "Snowboarding is a recreational activity and competitive winter sport that involves descending a snow-covered slope while standing on a snowboard attached to a rider's feet. The development of snowboarding was inspired by skateboarding, sledding, surfing and skiing. It was developed in the United States in the 1960s and became a Winter Olympic Sport in 1998. The precursor to snowboards was invented in 1929, by an American, Mr. Sherman Poppen, who lived in Muskegon, Michigan. His invention, which he called the \"Snurfer\", was made from two skis and a clothesline. The Snurfer was a sled that was ridden with the feet facing forward. The board was made of bamboo, plywood and polyethylene. The Snurfer was very popular and sold over a million units. In the 1960s, Dimitrije Milovich began using wooden planks as his snowboard to ride down the hills of Ski Cooper. He is often credited with inventing the modern snowboard. Tom Sims, an American, began making snowboards in his garage in the late 1960s. He later formed the Sims Snowboards company in 1976. In the mid-1970s, Jake Burton Carpenter, a Vermont native, approached various manufacturers for help in designing a snowboard. He was turned down by several companies, including K2 and Head. In 1977, he founded Burton Snowboards in Londonderry, Vermont. In the early 1980s, a surfer in Arizona, Tom Sims, began making his own snowboards, and he was soon approached by a local ski factory owner who wanted to manufacture them. In the late 1980s snowboarding became an Olympic sport.", "It's been just over half a century since the invention of the first snowboard, and now nearly 7 million people in the United States make snowboarding their winter sport of choice. But how did this relatively new sport come to be? Here's a look at the history of snowboarding. The Beginnings of Snowboarding In 1966, the first snowboard was invented by Sherman Poppen, an engineer from Muskegon, Michigan. His wife wanted something to do while he was surfing, so he tied two skis together and nailed them to a piece of wood, creating his first prototype. He called it a Snurfer, which came from the combination of snow and surfer. It was not long before the Snurfer became a sensation, selling 150,000 snowboards in the first two years of its production. The Snurfer was the first snowboard to be endorsed by the International Snowboard Federation in the late 70s. The Snurfer was a simple design, with a rope attached to the nose of the board for steering. It had no bindings and was ridden with both feet facing forward, mimicking the stance of a skateboarder."]}

The fuel used for incinerators is largely made up of household and industrial waste. Incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal, due to issues such as emission of gaseous pollutants and generation of toxic ash. The incineration process reduces the volumes of solid waste by 90%, and the weight by 80%, through combustion, leaving only a small volume of ash. Incineration and other high-temperature waste treatment systems are described as \"thermal treatment\".

This is a large tank that is buried in the yard. This is where the sewage is broken down through an anaerobic digestion process. There are 2 compartments in the septic tank. In the first compartment, the solid waste settles down to the bottom, where it is broken down by bacteria. The second compartment is where the liquid waste is stored. The liquid waste is then drained through perforated pipes into a leaching field. The leaching field is a series of gravel-filled trenches. These trenches allow the water to drain slowly into the soil. The bacteria in the soil help break down the waste in water. The soil acts as a natural filter to remove the waste. A septic tank lasts for a long time, but it needs to be pumped out every 3 to 5 years. The solid waste that settles to the bottom of the tank is called sludge.

It is also the fact that African-Americans are incarcerated at much higher rates than other races.", "The Black Lives Matter movement has been sparked by a number of events. The first was the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, followed by the death of Michael Brown in 2014 and the death of Freddie Gray in 2015. Another motivation for the movement was the death of Sandra Bland in 2015, who was found dead in her jail cell at the Waller County Jail. Bland was arrested during a traffic stop in Prairie View, Texas, after she refused to put out her cigarette.", "The Black Lives Matter movement is focused on the criminal justice system and police brutality. The movement has gained traction and grown through social media. The Black Lives Matter movement, although not formally affiliated with the Black Power movement of the 1960s, is an extension of it, and shares its goals of fighting racism and discrimination against black people.", "Black Lives Matter is a movement that began as a social media campaign to end police violence against African Americans. The first time #BlackLivesMatter went viral was in July 2013, after George Zimmerman was acquitted of the murder of Trayvon Martin. The movement has been credited with bringing national attention to a number of cases involving the deaths of African Americans in encounters with police and with broader questions of racial profiling, police brutality and racial inequality in the United States criminal justice system. Many writers have stated that the movement is ineffective, and has limited political goals."]}
