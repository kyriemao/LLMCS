Both the EFSA and the HSE accept data from the developer of the GMO, which is then reviewed by a panel of experts.  The HSE prepares the risk assessment for the UK government, and the EFSA prepares a scientific opinion which is sent to the European Commission, which makes the decision on whether the GMO should be approved. Both the HSE and EFSA are funded by the UK and EU governments respectively, and have been criticised for conflicts of interest. There is a heavy reliance on the data provided by the developer of the GMO, which is not always made available to the public. Both organisations have been accused of \"fast-tracking\" the approval of GM crops, leading to shortcuts in the process, and that the studies used to approve GM crops have been too short and narrow.  In the case of the GM potato Amflora, the EFSA approved the GMO for cultivation despite the fact that it had not been tested for long-term environmental safety.

However, under a new law signed by the governor of Vermont in 2014, the state will require labeling of genetically modified foods by July 1, 2016, assuming there are no legal challenges. In 2015, Connecticut and Maine also passed labeling laws. The first laws requiring labeling of genetically modified foods were passed in Connecticut and Maine, but they will not enter into force until neighboring states pass similar legislation. The requirements of the three states would be harmonized. The bioengineered food labeling law, signed by President Obama on July 29, 2016, requires the United States Department of Agriculture to establish a national mandatory bioengineered food disclosure standard by July 2018. The standard by which food will be determined to be bioengineered (BE) is yet to be determined. The law defines bioengineered food as containing detectable genetic material that provides for a modified trait and which is not created by traditional breeding or found in nature.

The sample is first treated with an enzyme that cuts DNA at specific locations. This is followed by a PCR reaction in which the DNA is amplified exponentially. This amplification is monitored by a real time PCR instrument (such as the LightCycler). The DNA probe is attached to a fluorescent dye that produces a signal that is proportional to the amount of PCR product.", "In this method, the researchers first extract the DNA from the sample. Then they add a specific set of primers, which are designed to bind to a target in the foreign DNA inserted in the GMO. If the target is present, the PCR will produce a product which can be detected. In order to detect contamination, the primers are designed in such way that they will only bind to the target in the GMO DNA and not to DNA in the conventional crop.", "The DNA-based method looks for a part of the foreign DNA inserted in a GMO. The DNA is extracted and the DNA sequences are amplified in a PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) based on DNA primers specific for the GMO to be detected. Then the amplification product(s) are tested, for example by Southern blotting. Different DNA probes are used to detect the DNA of interest. The DNA probe is usually a fragment of the transgene or the plasmid backbone and is labeled with a fluorescent marker. The DNA probe is either a probe in solution (solution hybridization) or immobilized on a membrane (Southern blotting).", "The DNA-based method uses PCR to amplify a target sequence which is specific for a certain GMO.  The specificity of the method is ensured by choosing a target sequence which is characteristic for a given GMO. In the case of a positive result, the specific GMO can be identified.  The method can be applied to any sample that contains the target sequence, in general even if it is present in minor amounts. The method is not dependent on the presence of a functional gene or the protein expression. The method can be used in a qualitative manner, to test whether a sample contains a GMO, or in a quantitative manner, to determine the amount of GMO present. The DNA-based approach allows for the detection of a certain GMO in a given sample, but for a given target sequence can only provide a yes/no answer."]}

Honeybees live in colonies of up to 80,000 bees. There are three types of bee in the colony: queen bee, worker bee and drone. The queen bee is the only fully grown female in the colony. She is responsible for laying the eggs that will spawn the next generation of bees. The worker bees are all female but they are not fully grown. They do all the work needed to keep the colony going. The drones are male bees and their only purpose is to mate with new queen bees. A bee colony can collect nectar and pollen from as many as 100,000 flowers in a single day. The worker bees collect the nectar and pollen in special baskets on their legs and carry it back to the nest. They pass the nectar from one bee to the other using their tongues. By the time the nectar reaches the honeycomb, most of the water has evaporated. The remaining nectar is known as honey. The bees use the honey as food and they also use it to make beeswax.

The study of these structures uses social network analysis to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics. Social networks and the analysis of them is an inherently interdisciplinary academic field which emerged from social psychology, sociology, statistics, and graph theory. Georg Simmel authored early structural theories in sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and \"web of group affiliations\".

These approaches were mathematically formalized in the 1950s and theories and methods of social networks became pervasive in the social and behavioral sciences by the 1980s.

Over the next few years Poppen's invention, which he called the \"snurfer\" (a combination of snow and surf-board), gained popularity and by the late 1970s there were snurfer clubs springing up all over the snow-covered parts of the United States and Canada.", "Snowboarding began when Sherman Poppen, a chemical engineer, invented the snurfer, a skateboard-like device made of rubber and wood, in 1965. Poppen's wife, Nancy, suggested adding bindings to the snurfer, which resulted in the first snowboard, which was called the Snurfer.", "Snowboarding started with a simple idea: what if you strapped two skis together and tried to surf the snow? The man who came up with the idea was Sherman Poppen, a chemical engineer and avid surfer. In April 1965, Poppen was playing around with his daughters, Wendy and Terry, on the frozen shores of Lake Michigan. After asking his wife, Nancy, who was pregnant at the time, to tie some skis together for him, Poppen began to ride the little toy on the ice. When he got off, he called it a \"snurfer\" and his kids loved it.", "This was in 1929 when an engineer from Vermont, by the name of Sherman Poppen, created the first snowboard by attaching skis together, putting foot bindings on it, and using a rope to pull the rider along. He called it a snurfer, a cross between a surfboard and a snowboard. Poppen's invention was then further improved upon by Jake Burton Carpenter. Jake Burton Carpenter created the first snowboard with bindings in the late 1970s, and thereafter the sport was born. He founded the company Burton Snowboards, which is still producing snowboards today.", "Snowboarding is a relatively new sport, which is derived from surfing, skiing, sledding and skateboarding. It was first introduced in the United States and Europe in the 1970s. The sport was first popular in the United States, then spread to Europe. Many people think that the sport of snowboarding was invented by Sherman Poppen, a physicist and engineer in Michigan, who in 1965 came up with the first prototype of a snowboard. His invention was called a snurfer, which was a mixture of a surfboard and a sled. The prototype resembled a sled and had a rope attached to the front so as to steer the board. The first snowboard was designed by Sherman Poppen in 1965 and was named Snurfer. The Snurfer was a plastic sled, with a binding that attached to the rider's feet, and a rope attached to the front.

I'm going to go tonight if the weather is good.", "To teach yourself to snowboard, start by tying your boots so they're snug but not too tight, since you need to be able to move your feet freely. Then, go to a beginner slope and find a hill that's not too steep. When you're ready, slowly ride down the hill, keeping your weight on the back foot and your knees bent. The first thing to remember when you are learning how to snowboard is that you need to start out on a very gentle slope. As difficult as it may be, you need to remember that you are a beginner, and that you will not get better without practicing.

The daily use of certain medications, such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can also be a contributing factor. People with dry mouth can be at greater risk of tooth erosion because saliva is not present to protect the teeth.", "The most common cause of a chipped tooth is accidental trauma from a fall or other impact. In some rare cases, you can chip a tooth from biting down too hard on something. For example, sometimes people chip a tooth by biting on a popcorn kernel or something similar. Other times, people chip a tooth by biting into a piece of candy or food that\u2019s too hard. If you experience a chipped tooth, it\u2019s essential to seek immediate treatment. Chipped teeth can be extremely sensitive and may require professional tooth repair from a trusted dentist.", "Teeth can become chipped for many different reasons. The first reason is that you may have a habit of grinding your teeth. When people grind their teeth, lots of pressure is put on the teeth, which can cause them to chip. The second reason is that you may be taking part in sports, and if you're not wearing a mouth guard, you could get something hard in your mouth, like a foot or a ball, and it could chip your tooth. The third reason is that you might have weak enamel. Enamel is the protective layer on your teeth, and if it's weak, it can break off easily.

If it's really bad, your tooth could break and chip off.", "Chips can occur in all kinds of teeth, and they may be caused by a variety of different factors.

Bond the tooth with an artificial tooth-colored resin. Restore the tooth with a crown or veneer.", "Your dentist can fix a chipped or broken tooth in many ways. It depends on how badly your tooth is damaged. Here are some of the options: Bonding. If only a small piece of enamel is chipped off, your dentist might be able to repair it with dental bonding. During bonding, your dentist applies and sculpts a tooth-colored composite resin (plastic) to the tooth and then hardens it with a special light, which bonds the material to the tooth. Bonding can also be used to close space between teeth, lengthen teeth that have been shortened by wear, and change the color or shape of teeth. Bonding is usually done as an outpatient procedure. You do not need anesthesia unless the bonding is being used to fill a decayed tooth. Contouring and reshaping. Contouring and reshaping is done when you have healthy teeth that are too large, uneven, or have an irregular shape. The dentist uses a drill or laser to remove parts of the enamel. After the dentist has reshaped the tooth, it will be smoother and more even.", "If a tooth is only slightly chipped or cracked, the dentist may smooth the edge of the tooth and polish it. If the chip is small, the dentist may choose to reshape the tooth with a filing. If the chip is larger, the dentist may cover the tooth with a crown. If the chip is very large, the dentist may place a veneer over part of the tooth. A veneer is a thin piece of porcelain or plastic that is bonded to the tooth. If the tooth is severely broken or chipped, the dentist may place a crown over the entire tooth. A crown is a cap that covers the entire tooth. The dentist may also give you a root canal if the nerve of the tooth is exposed. A root canal is a procedure that removes the nerve and pulp of the tooth. Sometimes, the dentist may need to extract a severely broken tooth. If the tooth is extracted, the dentist may recommend an implant or a bridge. An implant is an artificial root that is inserted into the bone and replaces a natural tooth. A bridge is an artificial tooth that is supported by natural teeth on each side of the gap.", "For a minor chip -- one in which only a small piece of the tooth has broken off but the root is still intact -- your dentist may smooth the rough edge with a drill or file and polish the tooth. The dentist may also cover the tooth with a dental bonding procedure, which involves applying a tooth-colored composite resin to the tooth. Dentists also use dental bonding as a cosmetic dentistry technique to repair discolored, decayed, chipped, or cracked teeth. In more severe cases, where the tooth is severely chipped or broken, or a large piece has broken off, the dentist may need to use more extensive procedures to repair it. For example, the dentist may use a process called dental veneers to rebuild the tooth. Veneers are thin, tooth-colored shells that are bonded to the front of the tooth. Veneers can be used to repair chipped teeth, close gaps, and change the color or shape of teeth. Veneers are a more invasive procedure than dental bonding and are more expensive. Another option for repairing severely chipped or broken teeth is a dental crown. A crown is a tooth-shaped cap that is placed over your natural tooth to improve the tooth's appearance and restore it to its normal shape and size. A crown can also be used to attach a bridge, cover an implant, prevent a weak tooth from breaking, or restore one that's already broken.", "Dental crowns and veneers are two common options for fixing damaged teeth. Your dentist may recommend a cap, or crown, if your tooth is too damaged to fix with a veneer. Crowns are often used to cover teeth that are weak, broken, or severely discolored. For example, they can be used to cover teeth that have had root canal therapy. Crowns cover the entire tooth and can't be removed. A crown may be made of porcelain, porcelain fused to metal, or gold alloy. They can be matched to the color of your natural teeth. Veneers are thin shells of porcelain that are bonded to the front of the tooth. They are used to improve the appearance of the tooth. They can be matched to the color of your natural teeth and are custom-made to fit your mouth. Veneers can close gaps and make teeth appear straight. They can also be used to cover broken or chipped teeth or teeth that are discolored or badly stained. Other options for fixing damaged teeth include composite bonding and dental fillings. Composite bonding uses tooth-colored plastic resin to fill in the area of a chipped or broken tooth. It is used to help improve a tooth's appearance. Dental fillings can also be used to fix a broken or chipped tooth. A filling is used when a tooth is broken or chipped to a point where the damage can't be covered with a veneer or crown.
